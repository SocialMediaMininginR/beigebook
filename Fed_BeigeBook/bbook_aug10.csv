san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|4|Price inflation for most final goods and services remained subdued during the reporting period, with the notable exception of gasoline. While contacts noted an increase in the prices of oil and selected other commodities, resulting cost increases generally were absorbed in profit margins rather than pass-through to final prices. Restaurant prices were an exception, with notable increases reported. Looking ahead, contacts in general expect prices for their products to hold largely stable or increase slightly during the second half of the year compared with the first half.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|4|Retail sales continued to improve. Discount chains reported modest increases in sales, while traditional department stores noted stronger gains, particularly in the luxury segments of the market. Demand continued to improve for retailers of home furnishings and major appliances. By contrast, sales remained largely flat for grocers. Sales of new automobiles continued to strengthen, with high gas prices spurring especially strong growth for fuel-efficient vehicles. Similarly, demand for used vehicles remained robust.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|4|District manufacturing activity rose a bit on net during the reporting period of late February through the end of March. Makers of commercial aircraft and parts saw limited new orders, but an extensive order backlog kept production rates near capacity. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products reported some firming in new orders and indicated that they expect demand growth to pick up further in coming months. Capacity utilization rates continued to hold largely stable for petroleum refiners as weak domestic gasoline demand was offset by strong foreign demand for distillate products. Production activity was largely unchanged for metal fabricators, but demand remained quite depressed for producers of wood products. Food processors saw solid growth in orders and sales.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|4|Demand for agricultural products and mined metals remained strong, while extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production was uneven. Final sales and orders were robust for a broad range of crop and livestock products, and recent precipitation has eased concerns in parts of the District about drought during the upcoming growing season. Contacts noted increases in the costs of some inputs, such as fertilizer. Expanding activity in the mining sector continued to be supported by high prices for a variety of precious metals and metallic elements used for specialized industrial purposes. Mild winter weather continued to tamp down demand for natural gas, prompting additional declines in extraction activity, while elevated price levels and robust foreign demand spurred further increases in oil extraction.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|4|District home demand improved slightly but remained weak on balance, and demand for commercial real estate was largely unchanged. Sales of new and existing homes continued to improve modestly in certain areas of the District, although the pace remained quite lackluster overall. Furthermore, despite relatively low interest rates, contacts noted that tight financing terms more generally held down the pace of sales. With inventories of available homes still very high, new construction activity stayed at depressed levels and home prices remained largely flat. Demand for commercial real estate continued to be weak overall, as reflected in elevated vacancy rates and limited leasing activity for office and industrial space in many parts of the District. On the other hand, growth in the technology sector has led to rapid absorption of commercial space in certain locales, such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. As a result, increased construction activity for new office space is expected for these areas over the next twelve months.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|4|District banking contacts reported that overall loan demand rose modestly since the prior reporting period, and credit quality and availability improved slightly. While businesses generally remained highly cautious about their capital spending plans, the volume of new commercial and industrial loans edged up as businesses continued to pursue targeted investments geared towards increasing productivity. On the consumer side, demand for credit was largely unchanged. Credit quality improved slightly, with reports indicating a general decline in loan delinquencies. Although lending standards have remained relatively restrictive for most types of business and consumer loans, contacts reported modest improvement in overall credit availability. The reports also indicated that competition among lenders has been creating downward pressure on rates and fees for well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2012|4|Most First District retail contacts characterize year-to-date 2012 performance as strong, attributing this strength to mild winter weather and improving consumer sentiment. For February, year-over-year comparable-store sales increases ranged from low to high single digits, with the exception of one retailer citing a 23 percent rise. Furniture continues to sell well in the First District, as does apparel and other household items. Paper-based products are expected to see 3 percent to 4 percent price increases. While respondents are optimistic that performance will continue to be good, they remain cautious, noting that gasoline price increases might damp consumer sentiment.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|4|None of the 10 First District manufacturing firms contacted this round saw year-over-year sales declines in recent months, but performance varied. A semiconductor machinery manufacturer which generates most of its sales in Asia reports flat sales in the first two months of 2012, an improvement over declining sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. By contrast, an information technology equipment provider cites 18 percent sales growth in 2011 and continued strong growth in the first quarter of 2012. Geography matters, as firms with large operations in Europe saw slower growth and some outright overseas declines whereas firms more focused on the U.S. and Asia experienced better results. A contact in the information technology sector argues that the end of 2011 was strong because customers held back on spending during the weak spring and summer period but then made sure to spend that money before the year ended.
boston|Selected Business Services|2012|4|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report increasing revenues in the first quarter of 2012 and most say that the pace of growth, while not rapid, is sustainable. Despite the fact that recent growth is generally slower than at the end of 2011, contacts are relatively upbeat, partly because the faster growth of late 2011 represented a recovery from a very weak third quarter, in which several contacts experienced declining revenues and laid off workers. Revenue results, while good for marketing and advertising firms, are stronger for consulting firms, especially economic consulting. A firm that focuses on marketing and promotional materials saw year-over-year growth of about 10 percent while another that focuses on advertising cites stable revenues recently after rapid growth in the latter half of 2011. Strategy and business consulting contacts report growth around 5 percent, as clients who had previously been sitting on large stockpiles of cash are beginning to spend them to address pent-up need for consulting services cut during the recession. Clients have reportedly begun to focus on increasing sales and positioning themselves within markets rather than solely on cutting costs. Economic consulting contacts note that demand is extremely strong for high-end consulting and revenue growth is limited mostly by their own capacity to respond. Demand for health care consulting is generally strong, with the exception of pharmaceuticals, but some business lines have slowed as firms wait until the uncertainty over health care reform clears up. One consulting firm has seen rapid growth due to two new large government contracts, but notes that individual consulting firms' prospects are contingent upon the funding status of and uncertainty surrounding the specific agencies with which they do business.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|4|Reports from commercial real estate contacts in the First District indicate that conditions are largely unchanged since the last report. Boston's commercial property market remains more active than other New England markets, which are "quiet," a term one contact used to describe Portland. Contacts note that investment demand for prime office and apartment properties continues to be robust in Boston and expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future. Office and retail demand elsewhere in New England is moderate. Contacts in these areas do not foresee increases in vacancy rates, but note that a dearth of interest from potential entrants to these markets means they are unlikely to fall in the near future. Retail sector rents remain flat across the region and all contacts reported retail sector vacancy rates somewhere between flat and modestly decreasing.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|4|Residential real estate in New England shows signs of strengthening as sales continued to increase in February, except in Connecticut where February sales were close to year-earlier levels. According to most contacts, activity is improving across all price segments. Contacts cite low interest rates, falling prices, improving economic conditions, and milder weather as factors contributing to the observed sales increases. Nonetheless, contacts remain cautious about the prospect of housing-market recovery because home prices continued to decline across the six states. Most contacts attribute falling prices to distressed properties; however, they also say the role of distressed properties in the market is diminishing. In the Greater Boston area, by contrast, the median sale price of homes and condos rose in February compared to a year ago. Respondents say buyer activity in Boston has intensified and they are concerned that inventory levels will not provide adequate selection for homebuyers.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|4|Consumer spending continued to expand moderately. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased 7 percent in February compared with a year ago. February sales at a Montana mall were up about 10 percent over last year; remodeling activity was strong for new stores and expansions. March sales were up over 5 percent compared with a year earlier at a North Dakota mall. However, a Minnesota-based hair salon plans to close some of its stores. A Minnesota auto dealer reported that mild weather depressed service and vehicle sales during January and February, but auto sales bounced back in March. In addition, higher gasoline prices don't seem to be influencing buying decisions away from SUVs and light trucks.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|4|The continued warm weather aided construction activity. The value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was up in February from a year earlier. The value and number of new commercial permits increased in Fargo, N.D., during the first two months of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential building permits increased significantly in the Sioux Falls area in February. The number of single-family building permits increased in Minnesota in January 2012, compared with January 2011. Several new multifamily projects were planned for the Minneapolis area.
minneapolis|Services|2012|4|Activity at professional business services firms increased slightly since the last report. An accountant noted that this tax season was busier and that many firms saw an increase in earnings in 2011 compared with 2010. A bank director from Montana noted that law firms were experiencing mixed activity and that firms specializing in petro-chemical and environmental engineering were seeing increased activity, while mechanical and structural engineering activity was flat to down.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|4|activity expanded. A survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity in Minnesota and the Dakotas increased in March. A manufacturer based in northwestern Wisconsin announced plans to build a production plant. A mill in Minnesota will begin a $170 million conversion from producing pulp for paper mills to producing cellulose for textiles. A brewery in Minnesota is expanding its operations. In contrast, a manufacturer of recreational vehicles in South Dakota has halted production and may not reopen.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2012|4|Activity in the energy and mining sectors continued at strong levels. Oil and gas exploration activity in North Dakota increased since the last report, but was flat in Montana. A Federal Circuit Court judge upheld a permit for construction of a $10 billion oil refinery in southeastern South Dakota, which would be the first new refinery in the United States since 1976. A separate $500 million diesel refinery was in early planning stages in western North Dakota. Two District ethanol plants are planning conversions to produce a different biofuel. Ninth District iron ore mines continued to operate at near capacity. A mining firm is developing plans in northern Minnesota for a large underground mine to tap a recently discovered copper deposit. Meanwhile, a tribe in western Montana moved to block a copper and silver mine on a wilderness site.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|4|Agricultural conditions remained strong. Cattle ranchers benefited from both high beef prices and strong export demand as well as ideal weather for the calving season. Drought conditions remained in Minnesota, the Dakotas and western Wisconsin, but were abated somewhat by recent rain and snowfall. Drier conditions may actually lead to increased corn plantings in the eastern Dakotas by making long-flooded fields available. Unseasonably warm weather has led to reports of early spring wheat plantings in some areas. Prices received by farmers for wheat, corn, dry beans, cattle, hogs, eggs and poultry increased in March from the previous month, while dairy prices fell for the month and the year.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|4|Hiring activity outpaced layoffs since the last report. The new production plant in northwestern Wisconsin is expected to hire 300 workers. In Montana, a company that services student loans could hire about 100 more people this summer. A new wheat straw pulping and molding factory in North Dakota will create 100 jobs. A major Minnesota-based employer noted that fewer employees accepted a recent early retirement offer than expected. In contrast, a telecommunications firm in Minnesota will eliminate 85 positions as part of a restructuring plan, and a printer laid-off almost 50 workers.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|4|Production at District factories showed a small increase during the past six weeks, and a majority of manufacturers said that output was above year-ago levels. However, several contacts reported that the boost in new orders they had seen late last year is leveling off and they are uncertain about sales to European customers. Some of our respondents expressed a more cautious outlook than at the start of 2012, but they are not expecting a significant weakening. Shipping volume by steel producers and service centers was trending slightly higher. Demand is being driven by the auto, energy, and industrial equipment markets. Steel representatives are cautiously optimistic about second-quarter shipments, and they expect the positive growth trend to continue. District auto production showed a modest rise during February on a month-over-month basis, while increasing substantially from prior-year levels. Increases were attributed, in part, to the abatement of supply chain issues.
cleveland|Construction|2012|4|Single-family-home construction has improved slightly during the past couple of months, although overall sales remain at very low levels. Activity in multi-family construction and remodeling remains strong. Single-family-home builders are a little more optimistic in their outlook due to the time of year and low mortgage interest rates. A few builders reported reducing house sizes and altering interior specs as a means of holding new- home prices steady. Employment and wages were stable.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|4|Retailers reported that sales were ahead of plan during the past six weeks and increased by single digits relative to year-ago levels. Almost all of our contacts cited the unusually warm weather as a primary factor for the pickup in sales, which was seen across their product lines. However, several of our respondents described middle-income households as challenged. These consumers are trading down, looking for value, and they remain very sensitive to rising gasoline prices. Most retailers expect second-quarter sales to increase over prior-year levels, mainly in the low- to mid-single digits. However, grocers anticipate little change in sales. Reports on vendor pricing were mixed. Upward pressure was attributed mainly to rising transportation and offshore labor costs, with little emphasis on changes in raw material pricing. There was some reluctance to pass through rising costs to consumers. Inventories were characterized as being in good shape. Capital spending for the year remains on track. Outlays will be used largely for technology enhancements, distribution facilities, store expansions, and new store construction. Little hiring is anticipated except at new stores.
cleveland|Banking|2012|4|Demand for business credit was described as either steady or rising, with a majority of bankers telling us that loan pricing remains competitive. Requests are being driven by commercial real estate, including multifamily housing, and healthcare. Consumer credit requests rose slightly during the past six weeks. Demand was mainly for auto lending (direct and indirect) and home equity lines of credit. Several community bankers commented that it is difficult competing against large banks, credit unions, and captives, especially for motor vehicle loans. In the residential mortgage market, demand was described as steady to very strong. A high percentage of applicants are looking to refinance. No changes were made to loan application standards. Delinquencies were generally steady or declined; any increases were found largely in real estate portfolios. Core deposits continued to grow. Payrolls were stable, with little hiring expected.
cleveland|Energy|2012|4|Conventional oil and natural gas drilling and production were flat since our last report, with little change expected in the upcoming weeks. Our contacts attributed these conditions to low natural gas prices and regulatory costs. Well-head prices for oil were up slightly. Leasing activity in Ohio's Utica shale continues to expand, and energy companies are redeploying drilling resources from dry gas to the wet gas areas of the Marcellus shale due to its significantly higher market value. The outlook for coal production during 2012 is similar to 2011 levels. However, there is a growing likelihood that output will decline due to the regulatory environment and lessening demand from electrical utility companies and offshore markets. Spot prices for metallurgical and steam coals continued to decline. Production equipment and materials prices were fairly steady except for rising diesel fuel prices and the cost of items tied to steel.  payrolls were stable, though some small oil and gas companies are considering layoffs because of reduced revenues.
cleveland|Transportation|2012|4|Freight transport volume has been trending higher during the past few weeks. Industries driving demand include energy and metals. One executive noted a significant upswing in long-term leasing of his railroad cars. Volume is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace for the remainder of the year. Costs associated with truck maintenance have begun stabilizing after increasing for two consecutive quarters. The price of diesel fuel continues to rise, although a few of our contacts characterized it as manageable. Some of the increase was passed through via surcharges. Capital spending for 2012 remains on plan. Outlays are allocated for replacement of aging units and adding capacity, although it remains difficult to recruit qualified drivers. We heard two reports of additional drivers being hired to meet potential staffing requirements under the new hours-of-service rules. Some wage pressure exists due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|4|Most contact reports on consumer spending were generally positive. Sales of home appliances, furniture, and autos were solid, while apparel was more mixed. Most retailers remained optimistic that sales would improve over the next three months, but noted that the impact of higher gasoline prices posed a downside risk to their sales outlook.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|4|The majority of residential broker contacts reported that home sales exceeded the year earlier level in late February and March. More than two-thirds of the brokers indicated that sales met or exceeded their expectations. Florida contacts noted strengthening sales, particularly in South Florida markets. Many noted that inventory levels across the District continued to decline on a year-over-year basis and, in spite of this, home prices were flat to slightly down compared with a year ago. The outlook among brokers for sales growth remained positive, with most anticipating modest year-over-year gains over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|4|Manufacturing activity across the Sixth District improved compared with the last report. Most contacts reported an increased level of both new orders and production. Several large auto manufacturers announced plans to hire more workers to meet increased demand for their products. A major industrial equipment producer and two medium-sized manufacturers announced plans to increase their presence in Georgia. Most manufacturers also indicated some increase in non-labor input costs.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|4|Contacts at community banks indicated liquidity levels remained high, a result of increasing deposit balances and relatively soft loan demand. Some contacts acknowledged a slight increase in demand for C&I and commercial real estate loans in some metropolitan areas, and a general rise in demand for automobile loans. In rural areas, however, low property valuations were said to be hindering overall loan activity. The demand for mortgages varied widely by market and some community bank contacts indicated that they have exited the mortgage origination market altogether. Lending standards at these institutions have remained largely unchanged. Smaller institutions noted tough competition from larger banks for credit customers. Many of these contacts expressed concern that regulatory compliance costs were affecting profit margins.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2012|4|Overall hiring trends were positive, but growth remained relatively modest in late February and March. While business contacts noted some increased optimism about the economic outlook, most firms continued to approach expansion plans with considerable caution. Among firms adding to payrolls, many were utilizing temporary or contract hires in order to contain costs and retain flexibility. Reports indicated that smaller businesses were looking to rebuild margins before proceeding to adjust their payrolls. Several businesses, including trucking related firms, asserted that they were faced with a lack of qualified labor. One large manufacturer addressed the issue of the lack of qualified workers by bringing back retirees on a contract basis to help train new hires.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|4|Investment in transportation infrastructure for oil and natural gas continued to increase; however, contacts noted that more investment is needed to accommodate recent increases in domestic and Canadian energy production. District refining contacts noted that the capacity to process the heavier grades of crude oil that are increasingly available is limited, despite recent investment in additional refinery capacity. While conditions improved in parts of the District, much of Georgia and Florida continued to experience varying degrees of drought. Contacts also reported that Florida citrus growers continued to fight greening disease. Prices paid to farmers for poultry and soybeans were up from the previous reporting period. Contacts continued to report concerns regarding available labor supplies in Georgia and Alabama, attributing this to the tougher immigration laws.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|4|Retailers report that sales were mixed but mostly steady and strong in February and the first few weeks of March. One major retail chain reports that sales were above plan and running more than 5 percent ahead of year earlier in both February and March, led by strength in spring apparel and accessories. Retail contacts in upstate New York report that sales in recent weeks have been strong and running roughly on par with a year earlier, which was also characterized as a very strong period, with continued strong demand from Canadian shoppers. However, another major retailer indicates that same-store sales were below plan and down considerably from 2011 levels. Retail prices continue to be mostly stable, but one major chain notes declining costs for apparel merchandise. Inventories are generally reported to be at desired levels.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|4|Housing markets across much of the District appear to have picked up since the last report, while rental markets continue to firm. Home sales are reported to be on the upswing in northern New Jersey, though prices are steady to declining, largely due to more distressed properties coming to market. One industry expert notes surprising strength in new multi-family construction in New Jersey--almost entirely rental units--thus far in 2012; this segment now accounts for well over 50 percent of all new homebuilding, which is said to be unprecedented. Apartment rental markets in both New York City and northern New Jersey continue to firm, with inventories tight and rents rising steadily. A major New York City appraisal firm notes that Manhattan's co-op and condo market has firmed since mid-February: while prices remain flat, sales have picked up--especially for studio and 1-bedroom co-ops--and new contract activity is estimated to be running 7 percent ahead of a year earlier. Conditions in the outer boroughs have been somewhat softer. Real estate contacts in western New York State report continued gradual improvement in home sales activity but note some downward pressure on prices.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|4|A major New York City employment agency specializing in office jobs reports that hiring activity has held steady since the last report. Legal hiring has picked up somewhat but for specific positions with specialized qualifications, while finance-sector hiring remains modest. More broadly, though, a sizable number of manufacturers and a growing number of business contacts in other sectors say that they plan to step up hiring activity in the months ahead.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|4|Small to medium-sized banks in the District report increased loan demand in all categories, but particularly for commercial mortgages. Bankers indicate increased demand for refinancing but to a less widespread degree than in recent months. Credit standards are reported to be little changed across all loan categories. Respondents note a decrease in spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds for all loan categories--particularly for commercial and industrial loans where well over two in five bankers report lower spreads, while none report higher spreads. Respondents also indicate some decline in average deposit rates. Finally, bankers report decreases in delinquency rates for all loan categories. Moreover, the reported decreases are more widespread among our banking contacts than at any time since the late 1990s.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|4|Consumer spending increased significantly in late February and March. Retailers reported unseasonably warm temperatures boosted retail sales. Because of the earlier-than-normal start to the spring shopping season, inventories of some lawn & garden, home improvement, and leisure items ended the reporting period on the lean side. Several contacts thought that the recent gains in consumer spending might dissipate over the medium-term, pointing to the temporary nature of the boost from warmer weather and concerns about the impact of higher gasoline prices on consumer budgets. Auto sales increased, with contacts noting improved availability of financing for prospective buyers with below-prime credit ratings. Dealerships continued to report some difficulty in stocking popular models because of supply-chain constraints.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|4|Business spending continued to increase in late February and March. Contacts reported that inventories were generally at comfortable levels, with the exceptions in auto and consumer goods noted above. Capital spending increased steadily. Purchases of heavy equipment picked up, led by robust activity in the energy sector. An exception was the coal mining industry which a contact noted was being negatively impacted by mild weather and the cheaper extraction costs for natural gas. Several manufacturers reported spending for technological upgrades as well as moving ahead with planned increases in capacity. Contacts also noted a pick-up in building renovation and increased spending on marketing and for labor force training. Labor market conditions continued to improve. Hiring increased, although it remained selective in many industries. Manufacturing contacts continued to report difficulty in attracting job applicants with ideal skill sets, and in some cases have reduced experience requirements or increased salaries to fill open positions. A staffing firm reported an increase in demand for light industrial, office and clerical, and IT and engineering positions. However, gains in these areas were being offset by declines in others, so that on net temporary employment was little changed.

However, gains in these areas were being offset by declines in others, so that on net temporary employment was little changed.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2012|4|Construction activity increased in late February and March. Demand continued to be strong for multi-family construction, particularly apartments. That said, a few contacts questioned whether current apartment building plans would lead to overbuilding in this segment. Overall, residential real estate conditions improved slightly. Single-family construction was up some from its depressed levels, as large homebuilders have seen a solid increase in sales in the last three months. Realtors noted some increase in activity in the market for existing homes, although many buyers are still waiting for prices to come down further. Foreclosures continued to put downward pressure on prices. Nonresidential construction also increased. Contacts noted a pick-up in industrial, healthcare and infrastructure building activity. Commercial real estate conditions were mixed by segment. Vacancy rates decreased for office and industrial properties, but contacts indicated that excess retail space continues to exist, especially big box stores and strip center/mall space. Commercial rents were flat, as was the available sublease space on the market.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|4|After a strong start to the year, growth in manufacturing production leveled off in late February and March. With an increase in quoting activity and deepening order books, contacts remained cautiously optimistic that growth would pick up again in the coming quarters. The auto industry continued to be a source of strength. Automakers expected sales to continue to increase over the year, but voiced concern that it would be challenging for production to rise much further above what is already planned given the capacity constraints faced by their suppliers. Confirming this production limit, several auto suppliers reported that they have already been asked by their customers to increase capacity. Capacity utilization in the steel industry was steady, but an industry contact expected to see some acceleration in production in the near term. Demand for heavy equipment was boosted by the need to replace ageing equipment. Exporters continued to benefit from advantageous terms of trade; and despite some softening in demand from Western Europe, again reported robust orders from Asia and Latin America.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|4|Credit conditions were slightly improved from the prior reporting period. Volatility and risk premia edged lower and concerns about European sovereign debt continued to subside. Several contacts noted an increase in risk appetite, pointing to higher demand for equities and real estate. Banking contacts indicated that business loan growth remained moderate, with their larger corporate clients continuing to cite policy uncertainty as a reason for caution in borrowing. In contrast, consumer loan growth picked up, with credit card usage increasing. Credit availability for households improved, particularly for auto loans and credit cards, where greater competition was leading to more favorable terms for borrowers. However, credit conditions remained tight for homebuilders and small businesses.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|4|Cost pressures increased in late February and March. Contacts noted higher energy prices, particularly for gasoline, although natural gas prices remained at historic lows. Prices for chemicals, steel, and non-ferrous metals also edged up. Wholesale prices increased; however, retail contacts indicated that it had become increasingly difficult to pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers. Wage pressures increased, but continued to be moderate. Contacts expected that wage and benefit increases this year would not exceed inflation. However, a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers contributed to upward pressure on wages to attract qualified candidates as well as improved benefit packages to retain current employees.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|4|Unseasonably warm weather has jumpstarted field work and corn planting in the District. There were reports of tight supplies of some agricultural chemicals, as well as some types of corn seed. Most of the District has sufficient moisture for a strong start to the corn crop. With spring planting taking place up to a month early, some corn will be harvested in August; combined with the potential of a record corn crop, concerns about corn stocks being low before the traditional harvest time diminished and corn prices moved lower. Soybean prices have risen in response to lower-than-expected harvests in South America. The increase in soybean prices relative to corn prices, as well as some acreage being removed from environmental protection restrictions, resulted in an increase in the number of acres that famers expect to plant in soybeans. Milk and hog prices decreased, while cattle prices continued to rise.
dallas|Prices|2012|4|Responding firms said prices held steady or increased, and several noted concerns regarding rising fuel costs. Food producers reported increases in selling prices to offset high input costs, and airlines noted higher fares. Intermodal transportation firms said they had increased prices in response to higher fuel costs, and parcel shipping firms noted plans to increase surcharges to offset rising fuel costs. Retailers and automobile dealers said higher gas prices had not significantly affected sales. Agricultural commodity prices declined since the last report.

Retailers and automobile dealers said higher gas prices had not significantly affected sales. Agricultural commodity prices declined since the last report.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|4|Most responding firms said employment levels held steady since the last report, although several noted slight increases. Staffing firms said demand softened slightly in March, but direct hires were still strong. Staffing contacts also noted shortages of skilled workers in IT and accounting. There were scattered reports of small employment increases in the high-tech manufacturing, transportation manufacturing, metals, auto sales and airline industries. Accounting firms noted a pickup in temporary workers due to the tax season. Wage pressures remained minimal, although slight salary increases were noted by some legal, auto and high-tech manufacturing firms.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|4|Overall demand for construction related products increased since the last report, although a few respondents' outlooks have become slightly more guarded. A cement producer and a lumber firm noted improving demand in the residential sector, while a fabricated metals producer said private projects related to oil and gas, manufacturing and highway construction were driving the pickup in demand. Primary metals firms noted that commercial construction projects including hospitals, schools and government buildings were a factor behind improving demand, along with solid sales to truck and trailer manufacturers.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|4|Retail sales grew modestly over the comparable period a year ago and performed in line with expectations. According to some national retailers, the Eleventh District's strength relative to the nation declined as warm weather in the north and east prompted strong spring clothing sales in those regions. Contacts noted that consumer demand appears healthier, and most expect moderate sales growth for the year. Inventories are being managed closely.
dallas|Services|2012|4|Demand for staffing services softened slightly at the end of March, following solid activity earlier in the year. Still, orders for direct hires remained strong and shortages of skilled accounting and IT professionals were reported. Outlooks were positive as contacts expect demand to bounce back in the second quarter. Legal firms reported a slight pickup in demand for their services. Contacts said mergers and acquisitions and transactional service activity had surpassed expectations, and there is continued strength in demand for intellectual property, energy and some real-estate related legal services. Accounting firms reported a modest increase in overall activity and characterize this year's tax and audit season as unusually good.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|4|Housing demand continued to pick up over the past six weeks. Tight new home inventories led to a modest rise in construction activity. Sales activity rose and inventories fell in the existing home market. Some contacts expect lower inventories to impact prices positively in 2012. Apartment leasing activity remained robust since the last report.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|4|Financial firms reported a modest uptick in loan demand. National banks reported strength in middle-market lending and large corporate lending activity. Regional banks also noted improved sentiments, and several banks suggested energy-related activity remains robust. Outlooks are generally less pessimistic, and some outright optimistic, with an overall theme that "loan demand is slightly stronger." The most optimistic contacts were large bank lenders or regional banks that expressed strength in renewed corporate lending. Loan pricing remains competitive. Outstanding loan quality continues to improve, and contacts continue to note fewer problem loans.
dallas|Energy|2012|4|Contacts at energy-related service firms said demand and backlogs from oil-producing areas remained very strong over the past six weeks. Many respondents, however, were concerned about weaker than expected demand for gas-directed drilling and a related decline in demand for fracturing services and horizontal drilling services. While respondents said overall demand in Texas is still very strong, several noted that crews were being shifted from dry gas-producing basins such as the Barnett shale to oil-producing basins such as Permian and Eagle Ford. While such disruptions were expected to be temporary, some contacts had lowered expectations for 2012.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|4|Rainfall continued to ease drought conditions in many parts of the District. West Texas did not receive much moisture, however, and the severity of drought there worsened over the reporting period. Prospects for 2012 crops are improved due to better soil moisture, and producers will have more flexibility with what to plant.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|4|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been mixed since our previous report. Several manufacturers announced plans to increase operations and hire workers, while a similar number of contacts reported plans to close plants and lay off workers in the near future. Firms in the pipe, bathroom products, all-terrain vehicle, construction machinery, processed poultry, and power tool manufacturing industries announced plans to increase existing operations or open new plants in the District. In contrast, firms in the oil blending and packaging and fish farming industries announced plans to close plants and lay off workers. In addition, a major firm in the printing industry announced plans to close a plant in the District and lay off a large number of workers.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|4|Home sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, February 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 10 percent in Memphis, 24 percent in St. Louis, 19 percent in Louisville, and 14 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District over this time period. February 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits increased 22 percent in Memphis, 63 percent in Louisville, 28 percent in Little Rock, and 25 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|4|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and medium-sized District banks were essentially unchanged in the three-month period from mid-December to mid-March. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.7 percent of total loans, decreased 0.4 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.8 percent of total loans, grew 2.2 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of loans, decreased 1.3 percent. All other loans decreased 8.8 percent and accounted for 5.8 percent of total loans. Over this period, total deposits increased 1.9 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|4|Monthly output of commercial red meat in the District for February 2012 increased 9.9 percent compared with February 2011. However, monthly output of commercial red meat declined 4.4 percent between January and February 2012. The number of chickens slaughtered and the total live weight also decreased by 4 to 5 percent between January and February 2012. The District's year-to-date coal production for early March was 3.5 percent lower compared with the same period last year. Similarly, the District's coal production for February was 2.4 percent lower than in February 2011.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|4|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported continued growth of new orders and shipments, although the pace has slowed slightly. Gains were widespread among the makers of food products, lumber and wood products, fabricated metals, industrial machinery, and instruments. New apartment construction, rising auto sales, and Marcellus shale activity are driving increased demand, according to various contacts. A lumber firm expects growth but mostly from market share gains. Manufacturers of food products and of chemicals expressed concerns about the impact of rising fuel prices on their input and output prices.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|4|Third District retailers reported modest growth rates overall but expressed greater certainty that mild weather had played a significant role in year-over-year comparisons. According to one contact, outlet malls fared better than broad retail but they should have experienced stronger sales. Gas prices pinched. While mild weather attracted more people, the average purchase per store dropped from year-ago levels. Overall, retail contacts see the economy firming but remain very cautious.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|4|Overall, loan demand has continued to grow slightly in the Third District since the previous Beige Book; however, activity has been uneven. Mirroring trends noted by other sectors, community banks note that the strongest loan demand has been for inventories and capital equipment to manufacturers and for investments in higher education, health care, technology sectors, and multifamily housing. One large bank contact noted strong demand from middle-market private equity firms, while the pace of refinancing had diminished. Most contacts reported solid credit quality.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|4|Since the last Beige Book, residential builders have reported mixed results for sales  and hence for their construction activity  depending on the extent of distressed sales activity in their region. Builders reported slower sales in southern New Jersey  where foreclosure rates are the highest  but continued apace in Pennsylvania. A Pennsylvania builder was more encouraged than at any time in the past five years; the company is doing more hiring for sales and for construction workers. One contact observed the resumption of heavy flows of specialized construction trade workers on the roads between Philadelphia area worksites and their Lancaster area homes; this level of activity has been absent for five years. Residential brokers reported strong, weather-aided year-over-year sales growth. The outlook among builders and brokers remains somewhat more positive.
philadelphia|Services|2012|4|Most Third District service-sector firms have reported further growth since the last Beige Book. Firms' strongest demand emanated from higher education and health-care institutions. Hospital systems reported rising admissions. Staffing firms reported mixed results, with strong orders from the manufacturing, health-care, and technology sectors. Demand for general administration and for clerical workers has been softer; however, clients were beginning to talk of hiring plans. Service-sector firms anticipate that growth will steadily improve in 2012.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|4|Price levels have changed little since the previous Beige Book  remaining generally constrained. Some deals and promotions are beginning to sap strong auto dealer pricing power. This was anticipated as Japanese automakers resumed normal production levels. New federal regulations, including medical certification requirements for commercial drivers, have exacerbated truck driver shortages. Favorable pricing power for freight shippers will push costs along to their customers and end-users. As a recent study predicts, these high costs could rise even further if the need arises to truck fuel to nearby markets that are currently being served by pipeline from refineries that are being closed. Price pressures have eased somewhat for manufacturing firms since the last Beige Book. Retailers and homebuilders continued to report tight margins with high, not rising, nonlabor factor costs. House prices have fallen further; however, nonresidential rents are stabilizing in some sectors. Contacts continued to report a lack of wage pressures, other than for medical benefits.
summary|Manufacturing|2012|4|continued to expand in most Districts, although respondents in the Boston and St. Louis Districts reported that manufacturing was mixed and Chicago reported that growth in manufacturing production leveled off after a strong start to the year. Contacts in automotive industries reported gains in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago. The Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts reported increased sales for high-technology manufacturers, with Dallas noting key demand drivers continue to be mobile applications, cloud computing, and automobiles. The Philadelphia and Dallas Districts indicated improvement in demand for manufacturing with ties to residential housing and construction. Cleveland steel producers and service centers reported that volume was trending slightly higher, while Chicago steel producers said that capacity utilization was steady. For refiners in San Francisco, capacity utilization rates continued to hold largely stable, as weak domestic gasoline demand was offset by strong foreign demand for distillate products. In Dallas, Gulf Coast refiners noted steady margins overall.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2012|4|Demand for professional business services was characterized as modest to strong in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported that demand was mixed. Boston and Richmond cited rising demand for advertising, marketing, and consulting services, while accounting services saw a modest pickup in Minneapolis and Dallas. Growth in technology-related services to the energy sector was noted in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. St. Louis and San Francisco reported that activity in the healthcare sector was flat to down. Both Richmond and San Francisco noted increased sales for restaurants and food-related service providers. Freight transportation services were higher in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts. Reports from Atlanta and Dallas were mixed due to declining air cargo volumes and railroad shipments. St. Louis reported that plans have been announced to close certain freight transport and distribution facilities. Contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City noted a shortage of qualified truck drivers.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|4|Retail spending continued to improve in almost all Districts. Contacts in the Boston, New York, and St. Louis Districts characterized retail activity as strong. Reports from Chicago and Richmond indicated a significant strengthening in retail spending. Sales expanded at a modest or moderate pace in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Unseasonably warm weather boosted sales in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Grocers in Cleveland and San Francisco reported sales as unchanged. Apparel sales were strong in Boston and New York. Purchases at home improvement stores were up in Richmond and Chicago. Reports from Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City indicate a positive near-term outlook for retail spending; however, contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City expressed concerns that rising gas prices could limit discretionary spending in the months to come.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|4|Residential real estate activity improved in most Districts, though Cleveland and San Francisco noted that activity remained lackluster or at low levels. The St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts reported increases in building permits. The construction of multi-family housing units, including apartments and senior housing, expanded in many Districts. Home prices continued to decline in Boston, New York, and Minneapolis, but were largely flat in San Francisco. Contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, and Kansas City indicated that mild weather had boosted real estate activity.
summary|Banking and Finance|2012|4|For most Districts reporting on financial services, banking conditions remained stable, with modest improvements in demand for lending. Loan demand was reported as improved in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while lending activity was unchanged in St Louis. The Dallas District reported improved sentiment by national and regional banks due to improved middle-market and large corporate lending. Contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco reported that increased competition among lenders has been driving more aggressive loan pricing. In general, the demand for commercial and industrial loans remained steady, while several Districts reported an increase in commercial real estate lending activity. The Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported increased lending for multifamily housing and health care, and contacts in Richmond cited increased lending to small business to finance inventory and capital expenditures. Consumer lending has remained stable or risen modestly across a few Districts. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts reported increased home equity and auto lending, while bankers in Chicago noted improved credit availability for auto loans and credit cards. Several Districts reported that credit standards remain stable, but Richmond bankers reported that they were offering easier terms to attract new commercial borrowers. Several Districts reported increased credit quality, as delinquencies have continued to decline and few problem loans have been reported.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|4|Recent rain and snowfall has helped alleviate dry agricultural conditions from earlier in the year. Nonetheless, the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts have all reported certain areas where drought conditions continue to persist. Due to unseasonably warm weather, contacts in several Districts reported that the planting of some crops is beginning earlier than normal, including corn in Chicago and wheat in Minneapolis. San Francisco commented that there has been an increase in certain input costs, such as fertilizer, while Chicago reported tight supplies of some agricultural chemicals and corn seed. Atlanta and Chicago reported an increase in the prices paid to farmers for soybeans; Chicago noted that the increase was due to lower-than-expected harvests in South America. Livestock prices rose in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, while orders for livestock were robust in San Francisco. Farmland values in Kansas City continue to rise and are at record highs.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|4|Hiring was steady or showed a modest increase in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Industries reporting some employment growth included manufacturing, freight transport, professional business services, and information technology. A preference for part-time and temporary workers was seen in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Atlanta noted that temporary workers were being utilized in order to contain costs and retain flexibility, while some employers in Richmond prefer temporary workers due to uncertainty about future demand. Some employers in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported having difficulty finding qualified workers, especially for certain high-skilled positions. Contacts in Philadelphia and Cleveland noted that new federal regulations are exacerbating a truck-driver shortage. New York commented that employers are planning to step up hiring activity in the months ahead. Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta said that employers in their Districts are cautious and need to see more robust growth before they expand their permanent payrolls further.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|4|Activity expanded moderately over the last month. However, shipments, new orders, and employment all grew at a somewhat slower pace since our last report, with several contacts citing the increasing cost of petroleumbased products as a major factor affecting their business. An automotive parts manufacturer reported that customer orders remained elevated, but he was concerned that orders and sales could weaken if recent high fuel prices persist. A contact at a lumber mill stated that he had seen improvement in both sales and output prices since the beginning of the year. In contrast, a paper producer said that his firm was experiencing a significant decline in business, adding that most of his employees were currently on a thirty hour workweek. A textile manufacturer said that synthetic raw material prices were "soaring," but that it was difficult to pass these increases through to customers. According to our recent survey, prices of both raw materials and finished goods grew at a somewhat quicker pace than a month ago.
richmond|Retail|2012|4|sales strengthened markedly since our last report. Gains were led by rising shopper traffic and an uptick in big-ticket sales, while inventories flattened. A store manager in West Virginia remarked that unusually warm weather had caused sporting goods sales to pick up earlier than normal. Additionally, home improvement sales were up at most of the merchants polled in our latest survey. A contact at a home improvement chain noted particular strength in sales of kitchen remodeling components. Higher gasoline prices led to freight surcharges, according to several contacts. Sales of both domestic and foreign cars remained strong, as consumers replaced aging vehicles and looked for better fuel-efficiency. Consumers continued to bargain intently, with a North Carolina furniture retailer commenting that margins were "the tightest they've ever been." A contact at a Virginia food chain remarked that customers were purchasing more selectively, as retail prices accelerated. However, a home appliance retailer noted that consumers absorbed significant price increases.
richmond|Services|2012|4|Revenues expanded at service-providing firms, despite concern about the rising cost of gasoline. Contacts at construction-related service firms reported an increased volume of business, and sales activity picked up at several advertising firms and travel services. Information technology firms also noted greater demand, particularly from the healthcare industry. Stronger demand allowed some trucking firms to raise prices to offset fuel cost increases. However, a trucking executive indicated that the shortage of drivers remained a serious concern. A manager of a restaurant chain in Maryland noted that people were eating out more, but area restaurants still needed to increase their use of incentives to compete for customers. Finally, a recent survey indicated that the pace of price change inched up at services-providing firms.
richmond|Finance|2012|4|Modest improvements in lending activity were widely reported since our last assessment. Officials at several large banks reported slow upward movement in commercial lending, particularly to small businesses that were financing inventory and new equipment. Several community banks around the District noted an increase in commercial lending for office and retail space. A lending officer in Richmond reported further strength in consumer borrowing, especially to meet home improvement and auto financing needs. Many bankers stated that mortgage financing remained weak, with the exception of home refinancing. However, several bankers from across the Districted noted a slight pickup in new home loans beyond seasonal norms. Competitive pressures among banks remained intense, putting downward pressure on rates. Several bankers reported that they were offering easier terms to attract new commercial borrowers. Loan quality and payment timeliness continued to improve, according to most bank officials.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|4|Residential real estate activity showed promising signs of recovery since our last report. Several contacts stated that they were beginning to see a "ray of hope" in the housing sector, and several builders reported starting construction in areas that had not seen new building activity for several years. For example, a source from Charlotte said that real estate was starting to move again in his area, and another North Carolina contact described multi-family housing activity, particularly for senior citizens, as being "on fire" in recent months. Lower inventory of both new and existing homes was reported in northern and central Virginia, with contacts noting that "days on market" were down as well. Moreover, a few contacts noted that housing prices had stabilized and, in some markets, prices were beginning to trend upward. Some agents attributed the rise in sales price to greater buyer traffic as a result of unseasonably warm weather. Several Realtors reported sales of higher priced homes were faring better than other price categories. A number of Realtors held a positive outlook for expected sales.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|4|Fifth District labor markets improved moderately in recent weeks, with several employment agencies citing strong demand for temporary workers. The increase in overall demand was attributed to a general strengthening in the economy and also to the opening of new companies, coupled with a revival in activity at previously dormant companies. Several employment agencies indicated that some of their clients remained uncertain about future demand, however, and preferred hiring temporary workers. A representative at a North Carolina staffing agency reported that demand for information technology workers was much higher than supply and that the gap was worsening. She added that schools did not have enough graduates to meet the demand in that sector. District manufacturers increased employment more slowly than a month ago, according to our latest survey, while wage gains picked up. Growth in employment and wages in the broad services sector nearly matched our last report.
richmond|Tourism|2012|4|Unseasonably warm temperatures contributed to strong tourist activity since our last report. A North Carolina contact from the outer banks cited exceptional attendance at early spring events. While beach house rental rates were unchanged in recent weeks, real estate rental companies were able to remove incentives that had been included since last autumn. In Washington, D.C., the atypical temperatures resulted in cherry blossoms peaking at the second-earliest date ever. Tourist-related businesses were busy and restaurants were full. This year marks the one-hundred year celebration of the gift of the cherry trees from Japan, with numerous special events planned, drawing a significantly higher volume of foreign visitors than normal. A contact described the crowds as "wall-to-wall humanity."
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|4|Consumer spending improved and expectations for the months ahead remained solid. Retail sales rose moderately from the previous survey, although several contacts noted concerns about lower discretionary spending due to rising gasoline prices. Store inventories remained stable and were expected to rise only slightly in future months. Auto sales rebounded strongly from the previous survey, with several dealers citing increased customer traffic and pent up demand as key reasons. Contacts said rising fuel prices have led to stronger sales of fuel efficient vehicles, and sales of large SUVs and trucks weakened. Expectations for future auto sales remained positive and inventories continued to increase. Restaurant sales improved, with further growth expected in coming months. Tourist activity edged higher, with several contacts noting increased business travel. Tourism contacts remained generally optimistic about future months.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|4|District manufacturing activity grew solidly, and expectations for future activity strengthened. Factory orders and shipments increased, and employment growth remained steady with some future hiring planned. Continued strong commodities-related activity boosted machinery production, and high-tech and aircraft manufacturing growth remained strong. Although rising gasoline prices and continued economic uncertainty restrained activity in several segments, most plant managers indicated moderate growth in capital spending plans. Growth in transportation activity picked up slightly, although several contacts cited driver shortages and higher contractor fuel costs as barriers to growth. Expectations for future sales were mostly positive, but capital spending plans among transportation firms were somewhat subdued. The majority of high-tech services firms reported solid growth in sales, but the pace of growth slowed somewhat from the previous survey. Several high-tech contacts noted higher activity in the energy and health care market, and future capital spending plans were generally positive.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|4|Residential and commercial real estate activity increased in late February and March, and expectations were solid heading forward. Housing starts edged slightly higher, with several contacts in Nebraska noting increased demand due to the booming agricultural industry. Expectations for future homebuilding remained positive, and building materials were generally available. Sales at construction supply firms were stable, with some contacts noting increased business among multi-family and remodeling contractors, and expectations for future activity were favorable. Home sales rose markedly from the previous survey period and inventory levels fell, which contacts attributed to seasonal patterns, favorable weather, lower interest rates, and newfound optimism in the overall economy. Expectations for future home sales continued to strengthen, and home price levels improved slightly. Mortgage lending activity was positive and remained above year-ago levels, though contacts expected refinancing volume to slow somewhat as rates begin to rise. Commercial real estate activity continued to edge higher, and expectations for future sales were mostly positive. Vacancy rates dropped and were expected to fall further. Office prices and rents remained subdued but were slightly higher than a year ago, and expectations were largely flat. Several commercial real estate contacts in Oklahoma noted strong sales due to heavy activity in the energy industry, while a contact in Missouri expressed continued financing difficulties.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|4|Bankers generally reported steady or stronger loan demand, stable or improved loan quality, and increased deposits. Overall loan demand was steady or improved. Most respondents reported stable to increased loan demand for residential real estate loans, while loan demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans remained steady. Loan demand was stable to weaker for consumer installment loans. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and the majority of respondents continued to report increased deposits. Most bankers reported stable or improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and every banker respondent believed the outlook for loan quality over the next six months would be steady or improving.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|4|activity grew solidly in late February and March, though the pace of growth slowed slightly from previous surveys. Contacts reported a sharp slowdown in natural gas drilling, with many noting a shift towards oil exploration. Natural gas prices reached decade-low levels in recent months, and most producers expected prices to stay low due to oversupply and mild weather. Crude oil prices climbed higher from the previous survey period, which many contacts attributed to continued Middle East conflict concerns. Contacts reported some shortages in equipment and labor, particularly for engineers and experienced technical support, and one producer noted continued delays in receiving permits for drilling on federal land.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|4|Agricultural growing conditions improved since the last survey. Scattered rains increased soil moisture levels in many areas, although drought conditions persisted in some western areas of Kansas and Oklahoma. Winter wheat development was ahead of normal with most of the crop upgraded to good condition. Mild winter weather was favorable for calving and encouraged forage growth, reducing the need for supplemental feeding. Spring field work began early, and crop prices moved higher. Low cattle inventories trimmed beef production, and strong domestic and export demand pushed up cattle and hog prices. Operating loan demand declined as many producers used cash to buy crop inputs. Farmland values rose further and were expected to remain at record highs.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|4|Prices rose slightly and were expected to continue to increase, but wage pressures were mostly contained outside of a few skilled positions. Retailers reported a slight uptick in prices with further increases anticipated. Manufacturing materials price increases continued and were expected to increase further, although fewer firms planned on raising selling prices. Higher prices for construction materials narrowed profit margins, as the majority of firms were unable to pass these costs through to customers. Transportation firms reported higher input prices, and increased food costs continued to impact profit margins and selling prices for hotels and restaurants. Wage pressures were still generally contained in most industries, although some firms reported continued difficulties in obtaining skilled labor.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|3|Price increases for final goods and services remained modest overall during the reporting period. Further increases were noted for an assortment of raw materials and commodities, such as oil, grains, cotton, lumber, and various metals, along with finished apparel and other products sourced from overseas. However, stiff competition among domestic firms, combined with continued low levels of demand, generally precluded pass-through of cost increases to final prices for retail goods and services, with the notable exceptions of gasoline and groceries. Looking ahead, contacts in most sectors expect that prices for their products will increase modestly over the next six months, with larger gains expected for food.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|3|Retail sales continued to improve relative to seasonal norms. Although consumers remained oriented toward spending on necessities and lower-priced options, the reports pointed to a gradual shift back toward discretionary spending. Discount retail chains and traditional department stores alike reported modest increases in sales, with inventories that were close to desired levels. By contrast, conditions remained challenging for sellers of furniture and major appliances, and grocers reported that their pace of sales slowed somewhat. Demand for new automobiles continued to strengthen, although higher-than-expected sales in December left some dealers with depleted inventories and an inability to fully meet demand in January. Sales of used vehicles remained robust.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|3|activity in the District showed further solid growth during the reporting period of mid-January through mid-February. Demand continued to expand for manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, with reports pointing to robust sales, high levels of capacity utilization, and inventories near targeted levels given the pace of sales. For makers of commercial aircraft and parts, modest increases in new orders combined with an existing order backlog to keep production rates high. Demand grew further for metal fabricators, with ongoing order backlogs and extended lead times noted. Utilization rates at petroleum refineries were above their levels from twelve months earlier, despite elevated gasoline inventories. Demand remained weak for manufacturers of wood products.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|3|Demand was robust for agricultural products and improved on balance for natural resources used for energy production. Sales and orders continued to grow for assorted crops and livestock products, although revenue growth has been partly offset by rising input costs, particularly for fertilizer and livestock feed. Rising export sales boosted activity somewhat for timber companies. Strong global demand continued to support an increase in oil extraction activity during the reporting period, and extraction activity for natural gas remained largely stable.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|3|Demand for housing in the District appeared to be little changed from the previous reporting period, and demand for commercial real estate remained at very low levels. The pace of home sales continued to be feeble throughout the District. In response to sluggish sales, new home construction has remained at depressed levels, although a few reports pointed to tentative signs of a pickup in the planning phases for new construction. Demand for rental space continued to expand in some areas, eliminating prior downward pressure on rents in some cases. Conditions in commercial real estate markets generally remained weak, as vacancy rates stayed at elevated levels in many parts of the District. However, further improvements in leasing activity, with tenants increasingly committing to longer-term leases, were noted for some of the District"s major markets.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|3|Reports from District banking contacts indicated that loan demand was up somewhat compared with prior reporting periods. Although businesses reportedly remained cautious in regard to their capital spending plans, demand for commercial and industrial loans rose a bit. Demand for consumer credit grew modestly as well. A few reports indicated that lenders' willingness to extend credit to small and medium-sized businesses improved in recent weeks, which respondents attributed primarily to perceived improvements in the outlook for existing business plans. Nonetheless, lending standards for consumer and business lending remained relatively restrictive. Venture capital financing showed further signs of improvement, with contacts noting ongoing increases in investor interest and IPO activity.
boston|Retail|2011|3|First District retailers report positive sales results for the months of December through early February, with comparable same-store sales increases ranging from low single-digit percentages to low double digits. Respondents are generally pleased with holiday shopping results; however, while a hardware contact benefited greatly from repeated snowstorms, others speculate that the inclement weather had a negative impact on their stores' sales.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|3|The vast majority of responding manufacturers finished 2010 with strong sales and have a positive outlook about current business conditions. A manufacturer that sells automobile and other components reports that sales in 2010 were its "best ever" and that sales growth has returned to its pre-recession pace partly because of strong demand from Asia. In addition, a number of firms in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries report better than expected growth in Q4; one semiconductor firm, in particular, indicates that sales were well above their pre-recession levels.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2011|3|New England software and information technology firms report increased activity through the end of Q4 2010 and into Q1 2011. Year-over-year revenue increases range from 3 percent to 25 percent in the most recent quarter, with most in the double digits. Contacts report increased demand for software and IT services from the industrial, medical, and education sectors, although some corporate clients remain unwilling to finalize deals. Increased activity has led most respondents to increase their headcounts; indeed, two plan to grow their staff by 10 percent in 2011. Wages continue to trend upward, with most respondents awarding annual increases in the 3 percent to 5 percent range. Selling prices are steady, and two contacts observe less discounting pressure than a year ago. Capital and technology spending at contacted firms is relatively unchanged. The outlook among software and IT services respondents is generally positive, with most expecting steady or faster revenue growth in 2011.
boston|Staffing Services|2011|3|New England staffing contacts report that the upward trends of 2010 are continuing. Revenues are flat to increasing year-over-year, with increases in the range of 5 percent to 20 percent. Labor demand has generally increased, with notable improvements in the manufacturing, information technology, and medical sectors. Higher activity is also reported in the legal sector, with increased demand for paralegals and business support personnel. Conversions from temporary to permanent hires continue to strengthen, and a few contacts report an uptick in permanent placements. Labor supply is tightening somewhat in the region, especially at the high end, with most contacts reporting increasing difficulty finding qualified candidates for high-skill jobs. The downward pressure on bill rates seen throughout the first half of 2010 has lessened and pay rates are holding steady. Looking forward, First District staffing contacts are generally optimistic, predicting that the rest of 2011 will bring continued growth.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|3|The latest reports indicate that commercial real estate fundamentals in New England are either stable or moderately improving, depending on the location. In Hartford, vacancy rates and rents are roughly unchanged since the last report; job growth and associated office demand are currently sluggish, but are expected to improve by summer 2011. In greater Boston, vacancy rates were little changed, leasing volume held steady, and office rents edged up slightly, bouncing back from the trough of the recent downturn. Loan terms for greater Boston properties loosened slightly amid increased competition by lenders. The outlook among Boston contacts is for modest, if not rapid, growth and improvement in office and retail fundamentals in the coming months. In Providence and Portland, limited leasing activity in January was attributed to bad weather and contacts expect slow yet positive absorption of commercial space in 2011. Construction activity is limited across the region, with the exception of the multifamily sector and various small-scale rehab projects in the Boston area.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|3|Residential real estate results were mixed across New England in December, with some states experiencing year-over-year sales declines while others saw modest increases. Home sales continued to decline significantly in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine, while Massachusetts and New Hampshire posted modest increases in sales volume compared with a year ago. Contacts in Massachusetts and New Hampshire note that part of the increase in year-over-year sales stems from especially weak sales in December 2009, attributable to the (initial) expiration of the homebuyer tax credit in November 2009. Nonetheless, contacts throughout the region note an increase in activity in the past month and express cautious optimism about 2011.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|3|Consumer spending increased. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in January were up almost 2 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minnesota-based restaurant chain noted that January sales were up about 5 percent compared with a year ago. A domestic auto dealer in Minnesota reported that sales of new and used cars were strong. However, a Minneapolis area mall noted that traffic in January was down somewhat from a year ago.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|3|Commercial construction showed unexpected signs of growth. January commercial building permits increased from the same month a year earlier in Fargo, N.D., and Sioux Falls, S.D. A large software company recently announced plans to open a technology center in suburban Minneapolis. Residential construction activity decreased. The value of permitted units fell 7 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul in January from a year earlier, largely driven by reductions in multifamily construction; single-family home building remained stable. Residential permits fell in value in Sioux Falls and increased slightly in Fargo during the same period.
minneapolis|Services|2011|3|Professional business services firms reported increased demand for their services since the start of 2011. About half of the professional service firms responding to a mid-February Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey saw increased demand since the start of the year, while only 9 percent saw declines in demand. A contact from a large accounting firm reported higher than normal activity.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|3|output was up since the last report. A January survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. Forty-six percent of the manufacturers responding to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey saw increased demand since the start of the year, while 23 percent saw declines in demand. Several Minnesota metal fabricators noted a solid increase in orders since the last report. A Minnesota manufacturer of drill bits said production increased. A semiconductor chip facility in Minnesota plans to triple production this year. A steel component plant in North Dakota recently expanded production due to increased capital investment. However, a steel fabricator shut down in western Wisconsin, and a manufacturer in the Upper Peninsula reported that severe weather delayed a construction expansion.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|3|Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained stable at high levels since the last report. Mid-February oil exploration activity was nearly flat since early January. Wind-energy development projects continued since the last report. District mining commodity prices remained robust, and District mines were operating at near capacity. A company increased exploratory metal drilling activity in western Montana.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|3|Agricultural conditions continued to strengthen. Prices for most District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including wheat, corn, soybeans, cattle, hogs and poultry; however, dairy product prices decreased recently. The Minneapolis Fed's fourth-quarter (January) survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated farm incomes increased over the previous three months, and almost two-thirds of respondents predicted increases in the next quarter. A decision by the U.S. Department of  to allow planting of genetically modified sugar beets came as a relief to District beet producers who had already purchased large quantities of the seeds. Heavy snowfall this winter combined with a warm snap in February led to concerns about potential flooding in parts of North Dakota and Minnesota.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|3|Labor market conditions continued to strengthen moderately. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, an energy plant project at a paper mill will create about 170 new jobs. Demand for temporary manufacturing workers was well above year-ago levels at a Minnesota employment services company; strong candidates for permanent positions were recently getting job offers more quickly than a few months ago. Minnesota initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased 5 percent in January compared with a year earlier. In contrast, a telecommunications company recently announced plans to lay off 250 employees, and a defense contractor laid off about 250 employees in Minnesota. In North Dakota, a wind power manufacturer announced 150 layoffs.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|3|Reports from District factories indicate continued improvement in new orders and production during the past six weeks. Any declines were attributed to seasonal factors. Compared with year-ago levels, production was generally higher, with many of our contacts experiencing low double-digit increases. Manufacturers are fairly optimistic and expect at least modest growth during 2011. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume rose, with shipments being driven by energy-related, auto, and heavy equipment industries. Looking forward, expectations call for continued growth through at least the first half of 2011. District auto production showed a moderate increase during January on a month-over-month basis. Compared with a year ago, domestic auto makers showed a substantial rise in production, while foreign nameplates posted a slight decline.
cleveland|Real Estate|2011|3|New home construction was generally flat at a low level during the past six weeks, with purchases mainly in the move-up buyer categories. A few builders noted that most of their revenues now come from remodeling work. On a year-over-year basis, sales were mainly lower. Contractors expect construction to remain sluggish through at least the first half of 2011. List prices of new homes and discounting have shown little change, while some upward pressure on the cost of building materials was reported. Little movement was seen in land positions or spec inventories. We heard many reports of subcontractors struggling to stay in business due to very thin margins. General contractors continue to work with lean crews, and no hiring is expected in the near term.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|3|Reports from retailers indicate that post-holiday sales were on or ahead of plan and were generally higher than year-ago levels. Cold-weather apparel is selling particularly well, and purchases of select high-ticket items were better than expected. A few of our contacts reported that the low- to mid-market segments still face considerable stress. Looking forward to the second quarter of 2011, retailers expect transactions to rise on a year-over-year basis, with several anticipating low to mid-single digit gains. We heard several reports about increasing prices from vendors, which were attributed to a rise in the cost of agricultural commodities and labor issues in Asia. Accordingly, some retailers are considering raising their prices, especially for apparel and food products. Inventories are in line with demand. Some of our contacts plan to increase capital spending during 2011 for new stores, distribution centers, and e-business expansion, with a corresponding rise in payrolls.
cleveland|Banking|2011|3|In general, bankers reported that commercial loan demand was stable or showed modest growth since our last survey. Some bankers commented that demand is strongest from health care providers, small manufacturers, and energy companies. On the consumer side, conventional loan demand remains soft, although a few of our contacts told us that they are seeing a modest pickup. Direct and indirect auto lending continues to show strength, while reports on the use of home equity lines of credit were mixed. Interest rates for business and consumer credit were generally stable. Most of our contacts said that activity in the residential mortgage market has slowed (refinancings and new-purchase originations) due to rising interest rates and seasonal factors. Core deposits continue to grow, with most of the growth occurring in nonmaturing products. The credit quality of businesses and consumer applicants was characterized as stable to improving, while delinquency rates were trending down across most portfolios. Staffing levels have shown little change during the past few weeks. Selective hiring is expected during 2011.
cleveland|Energy|2011|3|Reports indicate that oil and gas output from conventional wells was fairly steady during the past six weeks, with little change expected in the near term. Leasing activity for Marcellus and Utica shale in eastern Ohio continues to expand, but few drilling permits have been issued. Spot prices for natural gas were flat, while wellhead prices paid to independent oil producers showed a modest increase. Coal production has been fairly steady since our last report, with little change anticipated in the near term. Prices for steam and metallurgical coal rose slightly. We heard several reports of a small rise in equipment and material costs, which was attributed to increasing commodity prices. Payrolls are expected to remain at current levels during the next few months.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|3|Reports on freight transport volume were mixed. Several contacts said that January's seasonal volume decline was greater than expected due to unusually severe winter weather. Looking ahead, carriers expect that markets will continue to recover and that sales growth in 2011 will be somewhat stronger than year-ago levels. Almost all of our contacts reported rising prices for diesel fuel, some of which were passed through to customers via a surcharge. Nonetheless, rising fuel prices continue to erode margins. Capital outlays are expected to rise during 2011 to replace aging equipment. However, the amount spent will be dependent on the availability of financing. Hiring thus far has been for replacement only, but two of our contacts noted that they are considering hiring additional drivers to add capacity. Slight wage pressures are emerging due to a growing problem with driver turnover and a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|3|Most District merchants reported that retail activity moderated in January and early February following better than expected holiday sales at the end of 2010. In addition, many cited bad weather conditions as having contributed to the reduction in traffic and sales. Retailers mentioned that they would not be adjusting inventories in response to the higher than expected sales at the end of last year. The majority expressed that they will continue using lean inventory management. The outlook among retail contacts for the next few months remained optimistic. District vehicle sales improved from low volumes witnessed a year earlier.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|3|District homebuilders reported slow growth in new home sales for January and early February, while buyer traffic weakened compared with late last year. The majority of homebuilders stated that construction activity was below the year-ago level. Some homebuilders noted rising material costs which they have been unable to pass through because of continued downward pressure on home prices. The outlook for sales growth over the next several months improved slightly from our last report, but the overall level of sales are expected to remain very low.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|3|Since December, District manufacturers experienced strong growth in new orders, while production levels increased moderately. Reports showed that the majority of respondents plan to increase production levels in the short term even as many manufacturing firms are experiencing higher input prices. District trucking firms noted both stronger demand and a firming of shipment prices; however, they also indicated that they have been facing increasing fuel costs and extremely adverse weather conditions, which have slightly affected overall activity. Trucking firms also anticipate capacity to remain tight as seasonal demand for shipments increase. District railroad companies reported that volumes remain solid for coal, automotive parts, and container imports. Many railroad contacts noted that higher fuel costs were successfully being passed through as surcharges.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|3|District banking contacts reported an increase in mortgage applications in January and early February; most of those attributed the increase in number of applications to refinance activity and lower interest rates. The majority of bankers stated that mortgage lending standards have increased in recent months; while a few bankers reported elevated standards remained unchanged. Small businesses related to construction and real estate in particular, described worsening credit conditions, with many indicating that they either did not receive the amount of credit requested or that they refused the offered credit because of unfavorable terms. Small businesses outside of construction and real estate reported improving credit conditions at community and regional banks.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|3|Labor markets across the District continued to recover slowly. Many businesses stated that their hiring plans favor leaving employment levels unchanged or to increase them slightly. Among those firms who plan to increase employment, the major factors driving their decisions are expectations of higher sales growth and right-sizing staff levels that were excessively decreased. District contacts maintained a preference for hiring temporary staff.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|3|Contacts along the Gulf Coast continued to express concern that the lower pace of drilling permit issuance and additional rig inspections would stifle future energy production and investment. Regional crude oil inventories have declined from unseasonably high levels in November as cooler weather and holiday travel boosted fuel consumption. Although drilling activity remains well below pre-oil spill levels, the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico has gradually crept up since October 2010.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|3|Retailers generally report continued strength in sales in early 2011. One major retail chain notes that sales were ahead of plan in January and on plan in February but that New York City underperformed the rest of the region--possibly due, in part, to the heavy snowfall during January, which is estimated to have reduced sales by about 1 percent. Retail contacts in upstate New York also report that sales have been brisk since the beginning of the year, despite a brief lull in early January, with one Buffalo-area contact indicating that sales continue to be buoyed by a steady flow of Canadian shoppers. Inventories are generally reported to be at desired levels, and the pricing environment continues to be characterized as highly promotional.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|3|Housing markets across the District have been generally stable since the previous report, with pockets of mild improvement. An authority on New Jersey's housing industry reports that the market has been performing slightly better in early 2011, as the negative aftermath of last year's homebuyer tax credit appears to have worn off. While there is still a sizable supply of existing homes on the market--including a large number of distressed properties--the inventory of available new homes in northern New Jersey is reported to be very low. The residential real estate market in metropolitan Buffalo also appears to have recovered to more normal levels of activity after several months of sluggish performance. There are signs of gradual improvement in Manhattan's apartment rental market: Rents continued to rise at a moderate pace, the inventory of available units is described as tight, and fewer landlords are reported to be offering concessions than last year. Conditions in Manhattan's co-op and condo market, on the other hand, appear to be holding steady: A major appraisal firm reports that prices are holding steady across the board and notes that, while contract activity fell noticeably in January, harsh weather is seen as the culprit, and transaction activity appears to be rebounding in February.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|3|Reports from business contacts generally suggest that firms tend to be adding workers, on net, and plan to increase staffing levels in the months ahead. A major New York City employment agency reports that labor market conditions are improving gradually and that hiring activity has picked up somewhat since the previous report. Financial sector hiring is reported to be up marginally--largely in the areas of trusts and estates--and legal hiring has picked up a bit from very low levels. A securities industry contact reports that layoffs continue but at a subdued pace; still, there is said to be little or no net hiring in this industry. Cash bonuses are reported to be down somewhat from a year ago, though overall compensation is seen as little changed. Most manufacturing contacts, however, indicate that they are currently keeping employment levels steady, though some net hiring is anticipated in the months ahead.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|3|Bankers report a decrease in the demand for residential mortgages, but increased demand for commercial and industrial loans and especially commercial mortgages; demand for consumer loans is reported to be little changed. Bankers indicate no change in the demand for refinancing. Respondents note some tightening of credit standards for commercial and industrial loans, on net, but no change in standards for the other loan categories. Bankers report no change in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds across all loan categories; spreads had been narrowing towards the end of 2010, based on the prior few surveys. Respondents indicate that average deposit rates have been steady to declining. Finally, bankers report a decrease in delinquency rates for commercial mortgages but no change in delinquencies for the other loan categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|3|Consumer spending increased in January and early February, but at a slower pace than during the previous reporting period. Promotions and sales continued to drive spending, but retailers also noted signs of improving consumer demand, including an increase in sales of luxury goods such as jewelry. Sales of some big-ticket items like electronics and appliances also improved after weaker than expected holiday sales. The pace of auto sales held steady at a relatively high level. Dealers remained optimistic pointing to pent-up demand in some market segments, improvement in the availability of auto financing even for lower quality borrowers, and increases in demand for new and luxury vehicles.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|3|Business spending continued at a steady pace. Contacts reported some additional strength in demand for equipment coming from agriculture and the energy industry. Spending on structures was more limited, but contacts also expected it to increase slightly over the course of the year. Inventories were little changed, although some manufacturers and agribusinesses were increasing stocks in anticipation of higher commodity prices. Retailers indicated that inventories remain in a comfortable range given the current pace of sales. Hiring picked up some. Manufacturers continued to add to payrolls, but again cited difficulty in filling certain skilled positions. Retailers also noted plans to increase hiring. A large staffing firm reported solid growth in billable hours for both industrial and office and clerical positions. They also noted that both temporary-to-permanent job transitions and direct hiring of permanent employees inched up further.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2011|3|Construction activity was again subdued. However, contacts anticipated an uptick in residential construction in 2011, particularly for multi-family properties where apartment builders were receiving financing and development contracts for new construction. In addition, single-family home construction, especially in uncompleted existing subdivisions, was also expected to begin to slowly increase. Activity in the residential real estate market was up slightly, and the pace of foreclosures slowed. Home prices were little changed, while residential rents were reported to be rising. Private nonresidential construction was flat, but builders noted a slight pick-up in activity for both office and industrial properties. Commercial real estate conditions continued to slowly improve. Contacts indicated that vacancy rates were flattening out, but some downward pressure on commercial rents remained.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|3|production expanded at a more moderate pace in January and early February. Orders, however, continued to be strong, and backlogs were noted to be rising. Several contacts also indicated that suppliers were facing challenges in keeping up with demand, particularly for industrial metals and heavy machinery. The steel, automotive, and heavy equipment industries continued to be sources of strength. A contact reported that active capacity in the steel industry was nearly fully utilized, but steelmakers remained cautious about bringing back on line currently idle capacity. Manufacturers of fabricated metals also reported strength in production and new orders. An automaker noted that sales had been better than expected in January, and an increase in production plans for the first half of the year may be needed as inventories remain lean. Demand for heavy machinery and trucks increased, with rental companies adding to fleets and end-user demand also on the rise. A building supplies manufacturer indicated that shipments currently were down, but that they expected an increase in shipments this year for the first time since 2005. A contact in the home appliance industry also reported lower shipments in January, but expected a bounce back in February.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|3|Credit conditions continued to improve in January and early February. With market interest rates rising, financing costs increased, but corporate credit spreads for a number of large firms in the District were slightly improved. Competition for commercial and industrial loans continued to be fierce, and contacts noted an increased presence of large banks in small business lending. Demand for business and consumer credit increased. Much of this continued to be refinancing of existing debt, but core loan demand was noted to be slowly rising. Credit line utilization also picked up, as working capital needs increased. While delinquencies remained elevated, loan quality continued to improve, albeit at a slower pace than during the previous reporting period. Several contacts noted that the banking sector seems to be on its way toward balance sheet repair with earnings improving, and may be starting to turn the corner on lending. Credit availability is beginning to improve for most loan types, although the bulk of lending is still going to the most high quality borrowers.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|3|Cost pressures increased in January and early February. Manufacturing contacts noted that increases in prices for industrial metals, such as copper and steel, and other raw materials were beginning to be passed on to customers. Prices for agricultural commodities like corn, wheat, dairy, hogs and cattle also moved higher, as did most energy costs, although ample supply continued to hold the price of natural gas at historically low levels. Contacts cited a combination of strong global demand, particularly from Asian markets, and tight supplies as factors behind the recent rise in commodity prices. Retailers reported higher wholesale prices, and expected that some pass-through would be necessary this year to avoid further squeezing margins. The construction industry, however, continued to experience downward pressure on prices despite higher raw material costs. Contacts also noted higher costs from increases in state corporate taxes and unemployment insurance, while wage pressures remained moderate.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|3|Last fall's harvest ended up being smaller than previously estimated. Moreover, stocks of corn were lower than predicted. Input costs for crop production moved up over the winter. District crop farmers were, however, in a strong financial position, as most of the fall harvest had been sold at high prices. Corn and wheat prices increased during the reporting period, while soybean prices changed little. More acres of corn are expected to be planted this year than last. Farmers reportedly also planned to expand acres under tillage a bit by clearing fence rows and wooded acres. Margins for dairy and livestock producers strengthened as dairy, hog, and cattle prices rose more than feed costs did.
dallas|Prices|2011|3|Price pressures increased somewhat since the last report. Many contacts reported higher input prices for fuel, metals, and other commodities, and some shipping and manufacturing firms said they had increased selling prices in response. Retailers reported increases in the price of food and sundry items, while cement producers noted that they had announced selling price increases for spring 2011. Some service-providing firms noted continued downward pressure on bill rates, while staffing firms said they were successful in raising fees for direct hire placements.
dallas|Labor Market|2011|3|There were increased reports of hiring activity compared with the previous reporting period. Staffing firms reported continued strong demand for their services. Some primary metals, fabricated metals, transportation, lumber, food, and high-tech manufacturers reported moderate employment increases. Accounting firms noted audit and tax work had prompted seasonal hiring. A few contacts in auto sales, legal, accounting and energy services expect to expand payrolls this year. In addition, retailers reported offering full-time positions to some workers that had been hired for the holidays, while others were laid off. Wage pressures remained minimal. There were, however, reports of higher wages at some firms in the accounting, airline and aviation industries, and high-tech manufacturers reported slight increases in wage pressures for high-skilled positions.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|3|Overall demand for construction-related products was flat over the past six weeks, although there were a few reports of an uptick in demand related to remodeling, commercial construction and multifamily housing activity. Contacts expect conditions to remain unchanged or improve slightly this year.
dallas|Retail Sales|2011|3|Severe winter weather adversely affected sales activity. Excluding the week of inclement weather, sales were flat to slightly higher compared with the previous reporting period. Discount retailers have seen year-over-year sales growth in the mid- to high-single digits, although about half of the increase in sales is due to higher gasoline prices. Contacts at discount retail firms noted sales of apparel and domestic goods strengthened recently. Overall inventories were at desired levels. The environment remains competitive but the outlook is for continued moderate growth in sales.
dallas|Services|2011|3|Staffing firms reported continued strong demand, particularly for high-skilled IT positions. Other areas of strength were transportation services, insurance, healthcare, and banking. Direct hiring activity picked up pace, and outlooks remained optimistic.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2011|3|Eleventh District housing activity remains sluggish, but contacts were slightly more optimistic in their outlooks. While comparisons with year-earlier levels are difficult because of the 2010 homebuyer tax credit, some contacts said traffic had picked up recently and that buyers were becoming more serious. Respondents noted tighter credit standards continued to hinder first-time homebuyer sales, although some realtors and builders noted sales in the higher-priced, move-up market had improved.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|3|Financial firms report a slight uptick in overall loan demand. Commercial and industrial loan activity remains mixed, but demand for residential real estate loans has picked up from very low levels. Loan pricing is highly competitive, and contacts at community banks report increased competition from larger banks moving "down market" in order to attract new business. Credit quality appears to have stabilized and in some cases is improving. Increased cost of regulatory compliance is restraining lending activity, especially for community banks. Outlooks have improved slightly due to improving credit quality, some deposit run-off, and increased optimism regarding the overall direction of economic activity.
dallas|Energy|2011|3|Drilling activity remains strong. Growth in the rig count has slowed as the disparity between oil and natural gas prices continues to shift activity away from natural gas and toward oil-directed drilling. Unconventional shale is the dominant factor driving U.S. drilling activity. Expectations are for the rig count to flatten out or decline slightly but margins are expected to remain strong through most of 2011. The rig count in the Gulf edged up during the reporting period, and there is little optimism about the short-term revival of activity in the Gulf as permitting remains slow for shallow and deepwater drilling.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|3|Exceptionally dry conditions along with extended periods of below-freezing temperatures adversely affected the vegetable crop in Texas, greatly stressed livestock and necessitated increased supplemental feeding. Demand for agricultural commodities was strong. In particular, the relatively high price of oil spurred demand for corn for ethanol production. Prices of agricultural commodities remained high, and rose further for corn, cotton, soybeans and wheat. High costs for corn and feedstock has led to a slight decline in feedlot profitability.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2011|3|Contacts reported that retail sales in January and early February were up, on average, over year-earlier levels. Half of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 25 percent saw decreases and 25 percent saw no changes. About half of the respondents noted that sales levels met their expectations, 33 percent reported that sales were below expectations, and 17 percent reported that sales were above expectations. About 38 percent of the contacts noted that their inventories were too high, while 21 percent reported that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook among the retailers for March and April was mostly optimistic. About 58 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2010 levels, while 12 percent expect sales to decrease and 30 percent expect sales to remain unchanged.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|3|Manufacturing activity has decreased since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to close plants and reduce operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to open plants or expand operations. Firms in the wood products, automobile parts, aircraft, and primary metal manufacturing industries reported plans to decrease operations and lay off workers. Additionally, a major firm in tire manufacturing announced plans to close a plant in the District and lay off workers. In contrast, firms in the medical equipment, automobile parts, and primary metal manufacturing industries announced plans to expand existing operations and hire new employees.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|3|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, January 2011 home sales were down 6 percent in Louisville and Little Rock, 1 percent in St. Louis, and 8 percent Memphis. However, 2010 single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with 2009. Permits increased 3 percent in Little Rock, 4 percent in St. Louis, and 2 percent in Memphis but decreased 9 percent in Louisville. Commercial and industrial real estate market conditions throughout the District remained soft. Compared with the third quarter of 2010, fourth-quarter 2010 industrial vacancy rates decreased in Little Rock and St. Louis, increased in Memphis, and remained unchanged in Louisville. During the same period, suburban office vacancy rates increased in Louisville, Memphis, and Little Rock, while they remained constant in St. Louis. The downtown office vacancy rates increased in Louisville, Little Rock, and Memphis but decreased in St. Louis. Commercial and industrial construction activity continues to be slow throughout most of the District. Contacts in Louisville reported that demand for commercial properties remains low. Contacts in northwest Arkansas reported that banks are very cautious in considering new development projects. Contacts in Louisville noted no new suburban construction completions, while contacts in St. Louis reported limited commercial construction. Contacts in Memphis, St. Louis, and Louisville expect speculative construction activity to remain weak. Nevertheless, contacts in south-central Kentucky reported that a few plant expansions are in progress, and a contact in western Kentucky noted some commercial regional projects are under way.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|3|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks showed little change in overall lending activity during the fourth quarter of 2010. During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to moderately weaker. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans tightened somewhat, while demand for these loans was moderately weaker. Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans remained unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately stronger. Credit standards for residential mortgage loans ranged from unchanged to tightened somewhat, while demand for these loans was moderately weaker.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|3|Annual figures for 2010 in the District's agricultural sector showed a shortfall of 2 percent or more in corn, soybean, rice, hay, and tobacco yields, compared with 2009. Cotton and winter wheat yields, however, rose by 2 percent or more from 2009 to 2010. Meanwhile, total production of corn, soybeans, sorghum, winter wheat, hay, and tobacco for 2010 was at least 4 percent lower than in 2009. In contrast, total production of rice increased by 18 percent and total production of cotton increased by 50 percent. Coal production for the District states at the end of January 2011 was 7 percent higher than a year ago.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|3|Third District manufacturers reported strong increases in shipments and new orders from January to February. Producers across a broad spectrum of 11 manufacturing sectors reported increased demand. Declines in orders were predominant only among producers of apparel and of testing and measuring instruments. Producers within the furniture, petroleum, and fabricated metals sectors reported no overall change in demand. Some manufacturers credited global markets and energy markets as drivers of new demand, and one specifically cited China's rising costs as allowing them to reclaim work previously lost overseas. Several manufacturers mentioned "tough winter conditions" as affecting shipments and lowering demand.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|3|Third District retailers generally reported modest year-over-year increases in sales in January and February. Snowstorms deterred shopping and limited the advance in sales in January, retailers said, but most of those contacted for this report indicated that sales rebounded in February. However, revenue increases have been adversely affected by clearance sales of winter merchandise. The consensus among merchants in the region is that sales will continue to grow as the spring selling season gets underway. Most of the merchants who gave forecasts expect sales to increase moderately. The general opinion was expressed by one store executive who said, "We are cautiously optimistic, although we do not think the consumer will step up buying strongly until employment picks up."
philadelphia|Finance|2011|3|At most of the Third District banks contacted for this report, total outstanding loan volume has been roughly level since the previous Beige Book. Overall, business loan and residential mortgage volumes outstanding have edged up at commercial banks in the District, but consumer loan volume outstanding has eased. The outlook among Third District bankers interviewed in February is that total loan volume will expand only slightly over the next two quarters. Bankers said that consumers will remain reluctant to borrow until employment begins to improve more steadily and that business firms are still focused on strengthening balance sheets rather than taking on more debt. One banker expressed a view shared by many when he said, "Creditworthy businesses are not looking to borrow."
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|3|Residential real estate activity remains "in the doldrums," according to builders and brokers throughout most parts of the Third District. A builder described traffic as "anemic" through January, as the typical winter lull was depressed further still by harsh weather across the District. While some builders noted a pickup in traffic in early February, the "slower-than-normal January means we won't know for awhile" whether overall trends are improving. While home prices continue to fall in most parts of the District, the softness is primarily in higher-end homes. The greater than usual prevalence of distressed property sales creates some additional competition for new homebuilders. While market participants "want to be positive," most seem to have grown weary and wary of anticipating any near-term improvement in the housing sector. They are positioned for a year of little or no growth.
philadelphia|Services|2011|3|Service-sector firms generally reported modest increases in activity since the previous Beige Book. Business-service firms generally have been posting slight gains as their customers see gradual improvement in their own activity. However, as one business-service firm noted, "Customers are keeping within their budgets, and we have to be responsive to that." Moderate improvement was also noted by firms in the telecommunications, professional services, and health care sectors. Most of the services sector firms contacted for this report expect slow growth in the months ahead.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|3|Reports from manufacturers since the previous Beige Book indicated still more pervasive increases in input costs. While much less prevalent, output price increases are becoming more widespread throughout the manufacturing sectors. Retailers generally indicated that selling prices have been steady or declining as they clear out winter merchandise. However, a growing number of retailers mentioned that wholesale costs are rising for goods they are purchasing for sale during the second half of the year.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|3|Retail spending strengthened compared with a year ago across all Districts except Richmond and Atlanta, where sales were reported to have softened modestly. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas commented that severe winter weather in January had a negative impact on retail activity. New York, Chicago, and San Francisco observed that consumers are still responding to promotions and discounting. Meanwhile, Cleveland noted that some of their low- to mid-market segments are still struggling. Some Districts observed an increase in discretionary spending; luxury and big-ticket item sales increased in Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco. Inventories were at desired levels in New York, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco, while contacts in St. Louis had mixed views about their inventory levels. Boston and Atlanta reported tight inventory management. The outlook among all Districts was for a modest increase in retail activity.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|3|Recent activity in residential real estate varied, but overall sales and construction remained at low levels across all Districts. The Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported a slight improvement in the level of recent activity, while Boston noted that activity was mixed across New England. New York described the housing market as stable with some pockets of improvement. Demand was unchanged according to reports from the San Francisco District. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas described recent activity as sluggish, and St. Louis noted sales continued to decline. Construction activity was described as flat or down by Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Philadelphia and Atlanta contacts attributed weaker buyer traffic in January to inclement weather, and Philadelphia noted a pickup in early February. Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas also indicated an increase in buyer traffic. Reports on home prices were mixed. Atlanta and Kansas City observed persistent downward price pressure. Home prices continued to fall according to Philadelphia reports, but mainly at the high-end of the market. Cleveland and Chicago contacts described prices as little changed. The outlook for residential sales and construction improved marginally, although activity is expected to remain at low levels. Kansas City contacts anticipate a seasonal surge in sales activity this spring. Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco also expect modest improvement, while little to no sales growth is expected among Philadelphia contacts. A slight uptick is expected in Chicago and San Francisco construction.
summary|Manufacturing|2011|3|Reports from eleven of the twelve Reserve Banks indicated that manufacturing activity improved since the previous report, while St. Louis attributed a decline in manufacturing activity to several factory closings. Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted solid expansion in production, but Chicago observed a more moderate rise in output than in its last report. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Minneapolis indicated that adverse weather conditions temporarily disrupted production. Philadelphia and Atlanta noticed that a higher percentage of contacts indicated that production levels would increase in the near term. Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas also described the manufacturing outlook as optimistic.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|3|Districts reporting on nonfinancial services noted increased activity. Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas observed rising demand for general professional business services, with several reports singling out accounting firms. Dallas noted that much of this rise in demand for accounting services was related to consulting and transactional work. Several Districts also cited increased demand for healthcare, insurance, and legal services. The New York District, while reporting that legal hiring had picked up a bit, observed that it was from very low levels. St. Louis reported overall strength in business services, although contacts in government services and religious organizations announced plans to decrease operations and lay off workers. San Francisco also saw improved demand for consumer and business services, but countered that providers of healthcare, legal, and accounting services reported that demand remained largely flat. Information technology and telecommunication providers experienced increases in sales, according to the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Kansas City observed softer sales by IT firms, especially those tied to federal stimulus spending, but noted that activity generated by data centers and e-commerce were characterized as strong.
summary|Banking and Financial Services|2011|3|Loan demand varied across District and loan category. Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco noted improvements in overall loan demand, while Kansas City observed a decrease. Demand for residential real estate loans increased in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas but was weaker in New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City. The New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts reported improvements in commercial loan applications. The Dallas District experienced mixed commercial loan demand, while St. Louis noted that demand was unchanged to weaker. Cleveland reported business loan applications were beginning to pickup but demand for consumer loans remained soft. The Philadelphia District expected little change in loan volume as consumers remained reluctant to borrow.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|3|Adverse weather conditions continued to hamper agricultural production in many areas. Extremely cold and/or dry conditions negatively affected crops or livestock in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts. Kansas City also reported poor growing conditions. St. Louis described mixed results for production in many crops, but large increases in rice and cotton production were noted. Most reporting Districts noted continued strong commodity prices were benefitting producers of cotton, corn, soybeans, wheat, poultry, hogs and cattle while there are also some reports of rising input prices, particularly in fertilizer and feed prices. San Francisco observed some boost in export sales for timber companies.
summary|Prices and Labor Markets|2011|3|Manufacturing and retail contacts across Districts reported rising input costs. Manufacturers in many Districts conveyed that they were passing through higher input costs to customers or planned to do so in the near future. Homebuilders in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts noted rising material costs, but acknowledged little ability to pass through the costs to buyers. Retailers in some Districts mentioned they had implemented price increases or were anticipating such action in the next few months. There is little evidence of wage pressures across Districts. Wages remained steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while moderate wage pressures were reported in the Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco noted that most wage increases were for workers with specialized skills.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|3|activity continued to advance at a healthy pace in January and February. An aluminum extrusion manufacturer reported broad strength in demand for semi-finished metals, which are often an early indicator of increasing manufacturing activity. An auto-parts supplier said that new orders at his plant remained high and had increased to the point where finished goods inventories were below desired levels. He mentioned that raw material and component suppliers had started to have availability issues due to worldwide demand (especially from China and India). A custom fabricator reported that his company was seeing acceleration in business and was also experiencing very competitive pricing in the market place. Several textile manufacturers to whom we spoke indicated that, while orders had strengthened considerably, raw materials prices were rising markedly, with no way for them to pass along the increase to their customers due to competitive pressures. Our latest manufacturing survey also indicated that prices of raw materials increased notably over the last month, while prices of finished goods were up more moderately.
richmond|Retail|2011|3|sales generally softened since our last report, although a few businesses noted flat sales or an uptick toward the end of February. Sales fell at apparel stores, auto dealers, appliance stores, and retail computer stores. In central Virginia, an executive from a hardware chain reported that sales were down, matching reports that we received from retail/wholesale building suppliers in Maryland and South Carolina. Contacts at department stores reported flat sales. In contrast, an auto dealer in the Tidewater area of Virginia said sales were "on the upswing." A West Virginia dealer told us that new car sales grew more rapidly in recent weeks. He noted that his service shop was also gearing up to meet increased demand for repair and maintenance of older cars. Finally, a few food and pharmaceutical wholesalers that we polled also reported faster growth in revenues.  prices grew somewhat more quickly in recent weeks, according to surveyed merchants, but many retailers anticipated a jump in price growth in the six months ahead.  wages rose, as more companies reported giving raises. A few executives and managers were apprehensive about their exposure to higher costs of healthcare benefits.
richmond|Services|2011|3|Revenues rose moderately at most services-providing firms, according to most District contacts. Executives at healthcare organizations cited normal seasonal demand for medical attention related to the flu, except in North Carolina, where some providers reported that demand for healthcare related to the flu was up notably from seasonal norms. Financial services businesses also reported somewhat stronger demand; a Richmond, VA contact remarked that the stock market is "giving folks courage," but he noted rising food and energy costs held down activity. Accounting and other business-to-business firms also reported an uptick. Average wages were flat at services firms and current price growth was mild, according to survey responses, but price growth was expected to accelerate over the next six months. An executive at a payroll service in West Virginia indicated that his prices will go up slightly in 2011, but noted that "times are still a little rough out there."
richmond|Finance|2011|3|Loan demand in the District continued to improve in recent weeks. Several contacts reported that small business lending in particular had increased, with much of the demand coming from capital improvement needs. Demand from medium and large firms was mixed, with some bankers stating that both were requesting more loans, while other lenders' gains were limited to medium-sized businesses. Much of the demand from large businesses was for mergers and acquisitions. A banker in North Carolina noted a marked pick-up in consumer borrowing, mostly with respect to credit card usage, but added that many consumers were paying down debt. A loan officer in Richmond noted a sharp increase in home repair loans. However, several lenders around the District commented on the limited amount of mortgage activity--both for new homes and refinancing. West Virginia continued to lag, with one area banker reporting that loan demand was weak, and the high rate of repayments made sustaining loan volumes difficult. Most bankers were encouraged by recent improvements in credit quality, with several noting that the number of problem loans had declined. Another lender stated that healthy businesses in his area were starting to have more confidence in the recovery and had come back for loans.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|3|Real estate activity improved slightly from low levels since our last report. Most realtors indicated that sales were about the same or up slightly, although an agent in the D.C. area said that the number of home sales had dropped during the last six weeks. Realtors across the District noted an increase in foot traffic, but reports of sales price changes were mixed. A real estate agent in Northern Virginia stated that prices continued to slip in February albeit less than a month ago. In contrast, an agent in the D.C. area reported that the median price was up moderately at the end of 2010. One contact said that the slight increase in mortgage rates had caused some buyers to act before rates rose higher. Sales activity varied by price range around the District, with most contacts indicating that sales were concentrated at the low end of the price range (although a contact stated that sales at the upper end of the price range were doing much better in his area). While several Realtors indicated that they had not seen any change in the proportion of distressed sales, contacts in Richmond and Greensboro noticed an increase in short sales and foreclosures during the past six weeks. Realtors generally were optimistic that housing sales would gradually strengthen over the next few quarters and prices would trend up slightly.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|3|Temporary employment agencies gave generally optimistic reports on recent demand for workers and were upbeat about future demand. A Richmond agent noted that more of her company's clients were finding permanent jobs, and she was optimistic about strengthening demand for workers in the near future. Similarly, the branch manager of a temp agency in Raleigh reported that several manufacturing customers had hired his clients for full-time positions. Moreover, a Hagerstown agent mentioned that his firm was hearing more optimism from their customers than in the recent past. He said that, "The recovery does not have a full head of steam yet, but it is clear that there is certainly more demand in many sectors of the economy." Nonetheless, several agents continued to report weak demand over the past six weeks, but they expected demand to improve over the next six months.
richmond|Tourism|2011|3|Contacts reported generally strong bookings during recent weeks, wrapping up the winter season on a high note. A Baltimore hotel general manager indicated that leisure group bookings were up and guests were returning to the lounge and restaurant; previously, visitors were cutting costs by eating at the coffee shop. In Virginia, the manager of a resort and conference center reported that sales of season ski passes nearly doubled compared to last year, and he noted that his organization was able to raise rates this year "with no resistance." A western North Carolina hotelier reported solid bookings for the weekend just before Valentine's Day, drawn in part by a widely attended event nearby. This is the off season for Mid-Atlantic beach rentals; however, a contact there reported that advance rentals rose since our last report, pushed by "value-added" incentives, such as price guarantees. The contact indicated that tourists were still dining out, but were more likely to use coupons, and that some high-end restaurants were "feeling the pinch." However, a West Virginia contact reported flat growth compared with a year ago, and he noted that customers waited to book until the last minute, as they monitored weather reports--thus, forfeiting any advance booking discounts. Looking ahead, most contacts expected a slowdown during the early spring "shoulder season."
richmond|Agriculture|2011|3|Colder-than-normal temperatures coupled with dry weather conditions throughout much of the region limited field work, hindered crop development, and caused farm income to decrease since our last report. In North Carolina, continued cold weather slowed field work, and freezing conditions and cold temperatures challenged livestock producers in Virginia and West Virginia. In many instances, livestock producers secured water sources by breaking ice in order to water their cattle. In addition, below normal temperatures in Virginia slowed development of winter wheat, although small grain crops in West Virginia were reported as looking better. Results of our recent agricultural credit survey indicated that income projections weakened somewhat as a result of the volatility in commodity prices and input costs, and that farmland values were below the previous quarter and year-ago levels.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|3|Many District retailers reported that unusually severe winter storms limited sales activity in January and early February. Several retail contacts noted temporary layoffs and reduced hours for workers in response to the inclement weather. Overall, sales generally remained at or above year-ago levels and most retailers remained optimistic that sales would increase in coming months. While auto sales softened due to severe winter storms, dealers were satisfied with inventory levels and expected a sharp rebound in sales in the near future. Most tourism contacts reported decreased visitor counts compared with month- and year-ago levels, and respondents indicated severe winter weather as a possible deterrent. However, mountain ski resorts reported strong results due to the heavy winter snowfall. Hotel operators reported that occupancy rates remained flat during the reporting period while room rates continued to decline. Most lodging respondents expected no change in occupancy rates and continued declines in room rates in the coming months.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|3|District manufacturing activity continued to expand, while high-tech services and transportation activity slowed somewhat. Factory production and orders expanded solidly, and backlogs rose moderately. Inventories of both raw and finished goods increased slightly. Many manufacturers hired additional workers and anticipated hiring gains will remain solid in the coming six months. Concerns persisted about rising input costs, but an increasing number of factory operators reported an ability to raise finished goods prices. Planned capital expenditures at factories were up, although most contacts reported adequate capacity. Sales at high-tech firms softened in the latest reporting period, especially those related to federal stimulus spending. High-tech contacts nonetheless noted strength in sales related to data centers and e-commerce. Transportation firms reported weak activity in the current reporting period but remained optimistic that conditions would improve in the coming three months. Several transportation contacts cited rising fuel costs and difficulty finding qualified drivers as possible constraints on future growth.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|3|Residential real estate activity remained sluggish in January and early February, while the commercial real estate sector showed further signs of stabilization. The residential real estate sector remained hampered by falling transaction volumes and increased inventories of unsold homes. Weak sales of both new and existing homes put further downward pressure on home prices, but real estate agents anticipated a surge in home sales this spring due to seasonal buying patterns. Although housing starts were flat, residential builders remained upbeat and reported a rebound in traffic. Commercial real estate activity stabilized with increased sales and leasing activity, reduced vacancy rates, and increased absorption. Nonetheless, further declines were reported in rents and selling prices and developers' access to credit remained constrained. Mortgage lenders noted a continued decline in mortgage loan demand and refinance activity due to rising mortgage interest rates. In addition, mortgage lenders noted a decrease in average loan size and higher average down payments.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|3|Bankers reported weaker loan demand, increased deposits, and an improved outlook for loan quality in the recent reporting period. Overall loan demand decreased slightly as demand for commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, and consumer installment loans decreased while commercial real estate loan demand edged up. For the fourth straight survey, credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories. Loan quality was mostly unchanged from the previous period, while the outlook for loan quality over the next six months improved. Bankers reported increased deposits with gains in transaction and money market accounts.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|3|The energy sector expanded further in January and February as oil and gas firms reported increased hiring and production. Natural gas production remained strong despite high inventory levels and only modest seasonal gains in natural gas prices. Exploration in the District shifted further toward crude oil and natural gas liquids, particularly in New Mexico and the Niobrara oil shale formation in Colorado and Wyoming. Producers anticipated continued soft natural gas prices and steady crude oil prices in the next three months, despite concerns over international instability. A number of energy contacts cited continued competitive pressures for drilling equipment and workers as constraints on future drilling activity, but access to capital was viewed as adequate. Wyoming coal production remained well above year-ago levels. Higher corn prices trimmed ethanol profits in recent weeks.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|3|Poor growing conditions and tight supplies lifted commodity prices and farm incomes since the previous survey period. While winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated due to dry, cold weather, recent snowfall eased drought conditions in the southern Plains. Heavy snowfall also limited grazing and prompted some supplemental cattle feeding. Tight global supplies supported high crop prices, boosting farm income. Cattle and hog prices strengthened with higher demand, but rising feed costs limited profits. Operating loan demand weakened as farmers used cash to pre-pay for crop inputs. Capital spending rose briskly. District contacts reported collateral requirements held steady and ample funds were available for farm loans at historically low interest rates. Farmland prices surged with rising farm income and robust demand for farmland, with the strongest gains reported in Nebraska and Kansas.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|3|Input prices continued to increase in many industries, but selling prices and wages generally remained steady. Contacts expected sustained increases in input prices, and most expected higher selling prices in coming months. Manufacturers reported persistent increases in raw materials prices and anticipated the upward trend to continue. Increasing commodity prices put upward pressure on food costs, particularly livestock products. Restaurants reported tighter margins as menu prices remained flat in the face of rising food costs; an uptick in fuel costs contributed to rising building materials prices. Firms reported little evidence of wage pressures across the District and anticipated little to no wage pressure in the near future. A limited number of firms expected to hire seasonal workers in the next three months, but few have considered wage increases to attract qualified candidates.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|6|Price inflation remained quite limited for most final goods and services. Contacts noted price declines for energy inputs, particularly oil, and for an assortment of food items at the retail level. More generally, upward price pressures were quite modest, as suppliers of final goods and services were readily able to meet the existing modest growth in demand.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|6|Retail sales grew modestly on balance. Gains were reported by traditional department stores and discount chains alike, although contacts noted a slightly slower pace of growth compared with the prior reporting period. Inventories generally were at or near desired levels given the current pace of sales. Demand growth slowed for retailers of home furnishings and major appliances, resulting in mostly flat sales. Demand was largely unchanged for grocers. Sales of new automobiles rose during the reporting period, although the pace of growth has moderated from that seen in the most recent reporting periods. Demand remained strong for used vehicles and combined with tight inventories to keep prices elevated.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|6|District manufacturing activity rose further during the reporting period of April through late May. New orders continued to improve for manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, and inventories were reported to be at appropriate levels given the prevailing pace of sales. Contacts in the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector reported robust demand. Orders grew a bit for makers of commercial aircraft and parts, driven primarily by demand for fuel-efficient aircraft, and an extensive order backlog kept production rates at very high levels. For petroleum refiners, strong global demand supported an uptick in capacity utilization rates. Demand improved slightly for steel manufacturers but remained depressed for manufacturers of wood products.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|6|Demand for agricultural products remained robust, while extraction activity for energy resources continued to be uneven. Orders and sales expanded further for most crop and livestock products, spurred in part by strong growth in overseas exports. However, contacts noted that the costs of energy inputs remained quite high, and they cited renewed concerns that drought in some areas may undermine growing conditions in coming months. For energy resources, elevated price levels continued to support a pickup in oil extraction activity. By contrast, price declines for natural gas resulted in a further reduction of extraction activity, primarily at sites for which the extracted amount of valuable liquid byproducts is low.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|6|District home demand improved a bit further overall, and demand for commercial real estate picked up slightly on balance. Sales of new and existing homes ticked up in many areas, although the pace remained well below its historical average. The pickup was supported in part by slight improvements in financing availability, which has been an important factor holding down sales in the recent past. Faster sales reduced the inventory of available homes, which in turn caused home construction activity to rise slightly in some areas. By contrast, home prices remained largely flat. On the commercial side, vacancy rates for office and industrial space stayed elevated throughout many parts of the District. However, contacts noted widening signs of improved demand. The San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle markets continued to benefit from growth in the technology sector, which is prompting rapid absorption of commercial space and encouraging new construction. Contacts noted improved demand for office and retail space in other areas as well, such as Boise, Idaho.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|6|Reports from District banking contacts indicated that loan demand showed further slight gains overall. Although businesses remained very cautious in their capital spending plans, demand edged up a bit further for new commercial and industrial loans. Furthermore, reports from most sectors suggested that capital spending is likely to increase modestly in the second half of the year compared with the first. Demand for consumer credit appeared largely unchanged. Further improvement in overall credit quality was noted, and continued fierce competition to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses has kept a lid on loan rates and fees. Overall, however, lending standards remained somewhat restrictive for many types of business and consumer loans.
boston|Retail|2012|6|First District retail contacts continue to report that business is good, consumer sentiment seems to be improving, and fears have moderated about higher gasoline prices hurting spending in other categories. Recent year-over-year sales changes range from near zero to gains of 2 percent to 5 percent. One firm, buoyed by recent performance, has increased its overall 2012 sales forecast from 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Consumer spending is particularly strong on adult clothing, household goods, and items related to home improvement and maintenance. While respondents have generally positive expectations for their businesses in 2012, some express concern that U.S. economic growth will be hampered by domestic political tensions and potential negative spillovers from a European economic downturn.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|6|According to our contacts, the manufacturing sector in the First District continues to grow, but the outlook remains guarded, perhaps slightly more so than in recent months.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2012|6|New England software and information technology firms report mixed results through May, with some experiencing continued growth and others citing modest slowdowns. Nevertheless, year-over-year revenue increases in the first quarter remained largely in the high-single digits, bolstered by steady demand from the healthcare and banking sectors and a resurgence of activity in the manufacturing sector. Indeed, one contact closed a deal in Q1 with a very large electronics manufacturer, and another reports that deal sizes are beginning to grow, particularly in their software solutions for manufacturers and distributors. Other contacts, however, assert that clients in general remain reticent to finalize large deals.
boston|Staffing Services|2012|6|New England staffing firms report that business conditions are largely unchanged since the previous conversations in February, with year-over-year revenue increases in the first quarter generally in the mid-single digits. Labor demand from the healthcare and manufacturing sectors is steady, and one contact reports renewed activity in the financial sector. However, demand for office and clerical assistance has weakened in recent weeks, and activity in the construction, civil engineering, and accounting sectors remains anemic. The number of permanent and temporary-to-permanent placements continues to grow, albeit modestly; however, two contacts say this trend is likely attributable to their own internal efforts to boost permanent hires, rather than improvements in labor-market fundamentals.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|6|According to contacts, commercial property markets in the First District remain in a holding pattern, with some signs of improvement. The strength of Boston's commercial market continues to stand out within the region and nationally, making it the target of a tremendous amount of investor interest. Construction activity in Boston appears to be increasing--contacts report an uptick in large-scale build-to-suit construction activity for the first time in several years. However, the market is still not strong enough to warrant speculative construction. In Portland, construction activity has increased significantly from the last report, propelled by projects in the public, industrial office, and multifamily sectors. Elsewhere in the First District, construction activity is muted. Strict lending standards are still the norm District-wide.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|6|Residential real estate shows further signs of improvement in the First District as year-over-year increases in sales continued in April across the region. Contacts report steady increases in market activity, which they attribute to low interest rates and competitive prices as well as confidence in economic conditions. In the Greater Boston area, sales continue to increase while inventories fall to low levels, particularly in the condominium market. Some respondents say activity among first-time homebuyers has increased, reflecting continued affordability. Reports also indicate increased activity for homes in the mid-price range. Changes in median sales prices compared to a year ago vary across the First District, with some states experiencing modest gains and others observing moderate declines. Rhode Island, where the median sales price in April dropped almost 8 percent from a year earlier, faced the largest price decline in the region, but the drop was close to zero excluding distressed sales.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|6|Consumer spending increased modestly. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased just over 1 percent in April compared with a year ago; the soft gains were attributed to an earlier Easter holiday and warmer weather in February and March, which likely pulled sales earlier into the year. Recent sales were up slightly at a Minneapolis area mall where a number of stores were undergoing or planning renovations. A Montana bank director reported that vehicle sales were up from a year earlier and a representative of an auto dealers association in North Dakota reported strong sales during the past two months, particularly in the western part of the state. Recent sales at grocery stores owned by a Minnesota-based company were down slightly. Meanwhile, a Minnesota-based electronics retailer announced plans to close six stores in Minnesota.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|6|Construction activity increased from a year ago. The value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was up in April from a year earlier. The value and number of new commercial permits increased in Fargo, N.D., during 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. Several new commercial building projects are under consideration in the Minneapolis area. However, respondents to the University of St. Thomas's semiannual Minnesota Commercial Real Estate Survey (May) expected higher land and building costs, which could dampen growth in construction. Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential building permits increased significantly in the Sioux Falls area in April. The number of single-family building permits increased in Minnesota in March 2012, compared with March 2011. Numerous new multifamily projects were planned for several parts of the District.
minneapolis|Services|2012|6|Activity at professional business services firms increased slightly since the last report. An engineering and design firm near oil producing areas of the District reported extremely strong demand for construction developments. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's annual survey of professional services companies in May showed that sales revenue, space usage, and profits are expected to increase over the next year. A medium-sized Minnesota services firm commented that they "feel optimistic and are trying to improve efficiency."
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|6|activity continued to expand since the last report. An April survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that production expanded in Minnesota and the Dakotas. A light industrial manufacturer in South Dakota reported the strongest capital expenditure levels in 10 years as it developed a successful niche business line. A cement factory in Rapid City, S.D., is considering a $100 million expansion. A steel mill in Minnesota announced a $50 million investment in upgrades.
minneapolis|Energy and mining|2012|6|Activity in the energy and mining sectors grew. Oil and gas exploration activity increased in North Dakota and Montana since the last report. A biodiesel refinery in Minnesota announced a $20 million upgrade to switch feed stocks from soybean oil to waste fats. District iron ore mines continued to operate at near capacity. Montana hard-rock mines were also busy, with numerous expansions underway across the state. However, District limestone quarries were still suffering from reduced cement demand.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|6|The agricultural sector maintained its strength. Warm spring weather allowed farmers to get into fields early and plantings of corn, spring wheat and soybeans in mid-May was well ahead of average in District states. In addition, recent rains alleviated drought conditions that had persisted until recently in Minnesota and the Dakotas. The Minneapolis Fed's first quarter (April) survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated that most lenders saw continued increases in farm household income and capital spending, though respondents expect growth to moderate over the next three months. Agricultural output prices have come down somewhat recently. April prices received by farmers for soybeans, cattle and chickens increased from a year earlier; prices declined for wheat, corn, hogs, dairy products and eggs.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|6|A number of employers with open positions noticed tightening in the labor market. Manufacturers in several areas reported difficulty recruiting skilled workers, particularly welders. Agriculture operations in the western part of the District noted difficulty finding workers for certain positions. An aircraft maintenance company recently confirmed plans to expand its operations in Minnesota with potential hiring of up to 225 people. In North Dakota an equipment manufacturer announced plans to create 200 jobs and in northwestern Wisconsin a recreational vehicle manufacturer will add almost 90 jobs.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|6|New orders and production at District factories were mainly steady during the past six weeks, with a few reports indicating a weakening in orders from European customers. Nonetheless, a majority of our respondents said that output was above year-ago levels. The outlook by manufacturers has grown more positive since our last report, buoyed by a pickup in activity in the construction, energy, and transportation sectors. Manufacturers expect that this pickup will continue through the remainder of 2012. On balance, shipping volume by steel producers and service centers was stable. Demand is being driven mainly by the auto industry. Steel shipments are expected to follow their seasonal drop-off during the summer. However, several of our contacts expressed uncertainty about the extent to which markets will pick up in the fourth quarter. District auto production showed a moderate decline during April on a month-over-month basis, while increasing substantially from prior-year levels. Year-over-year increases were attributed mainly to the abatement of supply chain issues.
cleveland|Real Estate|2012|6|Single-family home construction showed a moderate improvement during the past couple of months, and the majority of our contacts said that sales were significantly above year-ago levels. Contracts were almost all in the move up price-point categories. While builders are encouraged by year-to-date results, they are guardedly optimistic in their outlook. We heard a few reports of builders raising new home prices, though margins are still tight. Reports indicated a broad-based rise in building material prices. One respondent told us that suppliers are raising prices because there is a perception that the housing industry is on a comeback. Year-to-date sales of existing single-family homes showed modest growth relative to prior-year levels across the eastern third of the District. Several of our contacts noted that sellers are becoming more realistic and flexible about asking prices. The appraisal process remains a major challenge.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|6|Retailers reported that April sales held steady on a month-over-month basis, but increased by mid-single digits relative to year-ago levels. Contacts cited the unusually warm, dry spring weather as a factor for the pickup in sales across product lines. Nonetheless, several reports described middle-income households as stressed. One contact noted that his company is investing in the development of new products that would be more attractive to value-conscious consumers. All of our contacts anticipate that revenues during their next fiscal quarter will be above prior-year levels, mainly in the mid-single digits. Retailers cited upward pressure on vendor costs, which they attributed to elevated commodity prices and increased costs for packaging and off-shore labor. There was some reluctance to pass through rising costs to consumers. Inventories rose modestly, but they were described as manageable. Capital spending for the year remains on target, with a large majority of retailers expecting to increase outlays during the upcoming months. Monies will be used largely for technology enhancements, distribution facilities, and store remodeling. Little hiring is anticipated, except at new stores.
cleveland|Banking|2012|6|Demand for business credit is on the upswing. Bankers reported that loan pricing remains very competitive. Loan requests were broad based, with the primary drivers being commercial real estate, energy, and healthcare. Little change in consumer credit was noted. Products in highest demand were auto loans (direct and indirect) and revolving lines of credit. Consumer credit pricing held steady. In the residential mortgage market, demand was described as stable to very strong. A high percentage of applicants are looking to refinance, although a few bankers said that they are beginning to see a shift in applications from refinancing to new purchase. No changes were made to loan application standards; some respondents saw an improvement in the quality of loan applicants. Delinquencies were steady or declined, with several bankers citing a drop in credit card delinquencies. Core deposits rose. There was a slight increase in the number of new hires compared to a couple of months ago, but on balance, no change in payrolls is expected in the near term.
cleveland|Energy|2012|6|Conventional oil and natural gas production was stable, with little change expected in the upcoming weeks. Conventional drilling has slowed due to very low natural gas prices. Well-head prices for oil dropped slightly. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has issued 119 Utica shale drilling permits since January 1 and 68 horizontal wells are currently being drilled in Ohio. Coal production during 2012 is expected to be slightly less than 2011 levels. Spot prices for metallurgical and steam coals declined. Production equipment and materials prices were flat. Capital spending is expected to hold at current levels or decline. Little change was seen in energy payrolls.
cleveland|Transportation|2012|6|Overall, freight transport volume moved higher. A couple of contacts did report a modest slowdown beginning in April, although they were uncertain if this was the beginning of a trend. Sectors driving demand include energy and transportation along with seasonal products. Volume is expected to continue growing at a moderate to strong pace for the remainder of the year. However, all of our contacts expressed concern about the regulatory environment and the negative impact it could have on potential growth. Costs associated with truck maintenance moderated, and diesel fuel prices have declined, although fuel surcharges remain in place. Many carriers negotiated rate increases as freight contracts came up for renewal. Capital spending for 2012 remains on plan. Outlays are allocated for replacement of aging units and adding capacity. We heard two reports about small carriers reducing the size of their fleets due to high replacement costs. Companies are hiring for replacement and capacity expansion. Wage pressure exists due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|6|Reports from District retailers indicated that consumer spending improved in April and May. Merchants anticipate that sales will continue to grow at a modest pace in the near term. The auto sector remained strong, and regional dealers expect sales to remain solid going forward. Despite the recent slide in gasoline prices, merchants remained wary of the potential impact on personal spending. That said, few retailers reported significant changes in consumer behavior with the exception of those operating in rural areas.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|6|The majority of residential brokers said that home sales exceeded year-ago levels in April and May with many reporting that sales exceeded expectations. Strengthening sales, mostly from cash buyers and investors, were noted by most Florida contacts. Brokers observed that inventory levels across the District continued to decline. The majority of contacts reported that home prices were flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. The sales outlook among brokers remained positive with most anticipating year-over-year gains, albeit from very low levels of overall activity, over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|6|The District's manufacturing sector continued to expand modestly in April and May. Manufacturers reported growth in new orders and production, but noted that employment growth had slowed somewhat. A District auto manufacturer announced plans to add a third shift to meet increased global demand for their products. Auto producers continued to note concern about economic and financial conditions in Europe, a significant market for the region's auto exports.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|6|Lending standards remained largely unchanged since the last report, but banking contacts indicated that more applicants were qualifying for loans. Most District bankers commented that demand for refinancing mortgage loans continued to increase; more applicants had ample cash for down payments or enough equity in their homes to meet the loan requirements. Credit availability increased and competition among lenders for loans remained strong. Some bankers mentioned improvements in the general creditworthiness of borrowers and appraisal valuations.
atlanta|Employment and Price|2012|6|Regional employment growth remained positive, although contacts noted that uncertainty regarding future economic conditions was a major headwind for additional job creation. Employers continued to express difficulty hiring for specialized positions, such as those in information technology and engineering. Trucking contacts also noted continuing trouble finding qualified labor to meet new federal regulations and some manufacturers cited difficulties finding trained operators and welders. Skilled auto mechanics also appeared to be in short supply. Firms noted the importance of efforts by government and academic institutions to coordinate training programs with large employers. Contacts also indicated that private training programs funded by trade associations or industry groups were being developed to train workers where larger public programs were not available.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|6|Contacts noted that more investment is needed in transportation infrastructure to accommodate recent increases in domestic and Canadian energy production. District refining contacts indicated that the capacity to process heavier grades of crude are limited and despite investment in additional refinery capacity, a number of recent and planned refinery closures elsewhere in the country could imply that existing facilities may have difficulty meeting demand for distillate fuels, like diesel and jet fuel. Permits for offshore drilling have increased in recent months. Drought conditions worsened in most of Florida and Georgia and parts of Alabama. Prices paid to farmers for oranges were up and a contact reported these higher prices were dampening demand. Prices paid for soybeans were up on a year-over-year and month-over-month basis because of strong global demand and decreased supplies coming from South America.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|6|Retailers report that sales activity was mixed but generally steady in April and the first few weeks of May. One major retail chain reports that sales were running on plan and up modestly from a year earlier, with particular strength in home-related goods. However, another chain indicates that sales were slightly below plan and down considerably from this time last year, with weakness in home goods and fine jewelry. In general, New York City stores tended to outperform other stores in the District. Retail contacts in upstate New York report that sales in recent weeks have been brisk and on par with a year earlier, and note increased demand from Canadian shoppers. Retail prices continue to be mostly stable, though price declines are anticipated for fall-season apparel, due to the retreat in cotton prices. Inventory levels are well managed, and are reported to be at desired levels.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|6|Housing markets across much of the District have been mixed but, on balance, stable since the last report, while rental markets have continued to firm. The volume of apartment sales in New York City has been generally steady, with brisk activity at the top and bottom segments of the market but activity in the middle described as quiet. Home sales in northern New Jersey have continued to improve from a low level, but mainly due to a pickup in sales of distressed properties. Home prices in and around New York City are characterized as steady to declining slightly, in part because more distressed properties are coming to market. By contrast, real estate contacts in Western New York report robust sales activity and rising prices in recent months. Apartment rental markets in both New York City and northern New Jersey continue to firm, with tight inventories and rents continuing to rise. A major New York City appraisal firm notes that rising rents in the City continue to make buying more attractive, and credits this trend for the recent uptick in sales in the lower third of the market. Conditions in the outer boroughs have been somewhat softer than in Manhattan.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|6|Contacts across the District, on balance, indicate that business activity has expanded since the last report. Manufacturers across New York State report a noticeable improvement in business conditions and a growing proportion of non-manufacturing contacts report increases in business activity. In addition, business contacts in manufacturing and other sectors note a slower pace of input price increases and steady to somewhat higher selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|6|Small to medium-sized banks in the District report increased loan demand in all categories to a more widespread degree than at any time since the mid 1990s. The increase in demand was most prevalent for commercial loans and mortgages. Bankers also indicate increased demand for refinancing but to a lesser extent than in recent months. Credit standards are reported to be little changed across all loan categories. Respondents note a decrease in spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds for all loan categories--particularly for commercial mortgages where over three in five bankers report lower spreads. Respondents also indicate some decline in average deposit rates. Finally, bankers again report widespread decreases in delinquency rates for all loan categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|6|Consumer spending increased at a slower rate in April and May. Retailers indicated that the slower sales pace was due in large part to the unseasonable weather that had boosted activity during the prior reporting period. Spending on necessities increased, while outlays for big-ticket items like furniture, appliances, and electronics decreased. Inventories generally were at more seasonally appropriate levels. Looking ahead, some retailers are planning to add to inventories in expectation of a better back-to-school season than last year. Auto sales were flat, and auto dealers expect that sales will remain at about this pace through the fall. Some dealers continued to report difficulty in stocking popular models because of supply chain constraints.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|6|Business spending continued at a steady pace in April and May. Inventories generally were reported to be at comfortable levels. Strong expected sales growth, high rates of capacity utilization, and the need to replace aging equipment continued to support manufacturers' expenditures on plant and equipment. Outside of manufacturing, firms were more cautious in their capital spending, citing increased economic uncertainty. Labor market conditions were little changed over the reporting period. Hiring remained selective, and most contacts indicated that they had not changed their hiring plans. Some manufacturers were increasing overtime, but noted that orders were not yet strong enough to necessitate adding to their labor forces. Those manufacturers who were looking to hire continued to report difficulty in finding skilled workers. Several said they were easing job requirements, using internships, or increasing college recruiting to try to fill open positions.
chicago|Construction and Real estate|2012|6|Construction and real estate activity increased in April and May. Demand continued to be strong for multi-family construction, especially apartments, but also increased for single-family homes. The residential rental market strengthened, with rents rising further and one contact noting a shortage of single-family properties for lease in parts of the District. Realtors indicated that they were also beginning to see a pickup in demand in the for-purchase market for single-family homes, as more sales had multiple offers on them. Commercial real estate conditions also continued to improve gradually. Demand increased for urban office space, hotels, and education facilities, while it remained weak for suburban office and retail space. Vacancy rates edged lower, but remained elevated, particularly for retail properties. A contact noted, however, that some suburban retail space was being switched over to alternative uses.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|6|production increased at a steady pace in April and May. Capacity utilization in the steel industry reached its highest level since the end of the recession, as stronger demand from North American customers offset weaker demand from Europe and Asia. The auto industry remained a source of strength for manufacturing. Auto suppliers were operating at high levels of capacity utilization, but noted that production growth had stabilized after the large gains earlier in the year. Demand for heavy equipment, though still strong, decreased slightly. Contacts expressed some concern over current weakness in global demand, but indicated that the industry was still being boosted by domestic demand, notably by a robust rental market and continued strength in the energy and mining sectors. Agricultural and construction equipment were also noted as areas of strength, with dealers adding products for the upcoming construction season. Manufacturers of household goods and building materials continued to experience soft demand, although a few noted a recent pick-up in activity.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|6|Credit conditions were little changed on balance from the prior reporting period. Credit spreads and market volatility edged up. Business loan demand remained limited apart from steady growth in refinancing and capital replacement. For large banks, some of the weakness in the business loan segment has been offset by an increase in demand for other services, such as foreign exchange hedging and liquidity management. Banking contacts indicated that there continues to be fierce competition among lenders for creditworthy borrowers. Contacts also noted an increase in the availability of credit for commercial real estate and consumer auto loans, while lending standards for residential mortgages remained tight.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|6|Cost pressures leveled off in April and May. Steel prices softened, with one contact noting that weaker demand in Europe and Asia had contributed to the decline. Energy prices also moved lower. Wholesale price pressures eased some, most notably for cotton and dairy products, although transportation costs continued to increase. Retailers indicated that they were largely absorbing the higher transportation costs in their margins and continued to discount heavily items such as clothing. Wage pressures continued to be moderate, although many contacts noted an increase in healthcare costs.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|6|District corn and soybean planting in April and May were well ahead of last year's pace, as well as the five-year average. Corn planting was almost finished in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. The emergence of corn and soybean plants generally was also faster than typical. With an early and promising start, the corn crop may set a record this year, although dryness currently exists across much of the District. Corn and soybean prices fell during the reporting period, while wheat prices rose. Milk prices decreased, and prices are low enough to trigger some concerns about margins for dairy operations. Hog and cattle prices were higher.
dallas|Prices|2012|6|Most responding firms said prices were unchanged, although some noted that input prices ticked up slightly. Retailers said selling prices were stable, although food prices increased. Auto dealers said prices were unchanged. Transportation service firms expect lower energy surcharges by July due to recently reduced prices for jet and diesel fuel. In contrast, airlines expect a slight upward trend due to higher fuel costs compared to last year at this time. Agricultural producers noted lower commodity prices and input costs.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|6|Employment levels were flat to up slightly at most responding firms. Staffing firms said demand picked up over the past six weeks after a slight softening during the prior reporting period. Reports of small employment increases came from some high-tech, transportation, metals, construction materials and food manufacturers. Contacts in auto sales, staffing and transportation services also noted slight increases. Wage pressures remained minimal, although wage increases were noted by some legal firms.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|6|Overall demand for construction-related materials improved during the reporting period. Favorable weather and improved residential and commercial construction activity provided a boost to stone, clay and glass producers. Primary and fabricated metals manufacturers reported steady demand, and producers of lumber and related products noted a broad-based increase in orders. Construction-related outlooks were generally positive, but some contacts are concerned about domestic political uncertainty and unfavorable developments in Europe derailing the pickup in activity seen so far this year.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|6|Retail sales grew modestly over the comparable period from a year ago and performed in line with contacts' expectations. Strength was seen in sporting goods and men's and women's apparel.  Eleventh District sales growth was stronger than the nation on average, according to a large national retailer. Contacts noted that consumers still seem a bit hesitant, but business is improving nonetheless. Inventories are in good shape and being managed closely. Automobile sales continued to rise over the reporting period. Car sales were especially strong, but trucks were selling well too. Contacts' outlooks remain optimistic and they expect continued growth in vehicle sales.
dallas|Services|2012|6|Staffing services said activity picked up over the past six weeks, following a slight softening in demand seen during the prior reporting period. Shortages of skilled IT professionals continued, and several contacts reported an increase in demand for construction workers. Legal firms reported steady demand, with continued strength in corporate, intellectual property and energy services. Contacts also noted a slight uptick in estate planning, lobbying and real estate related services. Accounting firms noted a modest pickup in demand largely due to growth in mergers and acquisitions related activity.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|6|Contacts in the single-family housing industry noted consistent indications of recovery in Texas markets. Respondents said sales are up year-to-date, and some builders were beating sales expectations. Agents noted solid sales for existing homes, and outlooks are more positive. Apartment market respondents said that after first quarter softness, demand came back stronger in recent months, as expected. Texas apartment markets continued to outperform other parts of the U.S., according to contacts. Rental rate increases slowed, but remain relatively healthy. Apartment construction activity is still at low levels, but is expected to pick up in the second half of the year.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|6|Financial firms reported a modest uptick in loan demand. National banks reported strength in middle-market lending, auto loans and corporate merger and acquisition activity. Regional banks also noted improved sentiments. Several banks suggested energy-related activity remains robust. Some smaller business and middle-market deals have begun to crop up. Outlooks are generally less pessimistic, and some outright optimistic, with an overall theme that "loan demand is slightly stronger." Loan pricing remains competitive. Outstanding loan quality continues to improve and contacts note fewer problem loans.
dallas|Energy|2012|6|Respondents at energy-related firms said drilling activity remained strong, and the District rig count grew modestly over the past six weeks. The shift from dry-gas drilling to wet-gas or oil-directed drilling continued, and some firms noted logistical problems as they try to move crews and equipment. Overall, contacts say that outside of pressure pumping and fracturing used in dry-gas drilling, the market for oil field machinery and services remains very strong.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|6|Drought conditions improved over the reporting period, particularly in West Texas thanks to recent rains. Better soil moisture continued to improve prospects for the 2012 crop year, and pastures greened up for livestock producers. The wheat harvest began and yields so far were above average.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2012|6|Contacts reported that retail sales in April and early May were up slightly, on average, over year-earlier levels. About 60 percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 12 percent saw decreases and 28 percent saw no changes. Thirty-seven percent of the retailers noted that sales levels met their expectations, 42 percent reported that sales were below expectations, and 21 percent reported that sales were above expectations. Twenty percent of the retailers noted that their inventories were too high, while 12 percent indicated that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook for the summer was positive: 56 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while 24 percent expect sales to decrease and 20 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's sales.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|6|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been mixed since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and hire workers, while a similar number of contacts reported plans to close plants and lay off workers in the near future. Firms in the paper product, agriculture, chemical, paint, and military and police equipment manufacturing industries reported plans to decrease existing operations or close plants in the District. In contrast, contacts in the automobile parts, wood product, solar panel, and steel product manufacturing industries reported plans to hire workers and increase operations.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|6|Home sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, April 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 13 percent in Louisville, 3 percent in Little Rock, 20 percent in Memphis, and 18 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District over this time period. April 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits increased 35 percent in Louisville, 20 percent in Little Rock, 31 percent in Memphis, and 28 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|6|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks indicated moderate changes in overall lending activity during the first quarter of 2012. During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged, while demand for such loans was moderately stronger. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans generally remained unchanged. Demand for commercial real estate loans ranged from unchanged to substantially stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans ranged from basically unchanged to somewhat eased, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to moderately stronger. Respondents noted that credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans remained unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from about the same to substantially stronger.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|6|Crop moisture levels from April to mid-May were classified as slightly dry to favorably moist in most of the District except southern Arkansas and most of Mississippi. Rates of completion for the planting of corn, cotton, rice, sorghum, and soybeans were at least 15 percentage points higher than their 5-year average rates in most District states, while crop emergence was also ahead of schedule. More than 88 percent of the winter wheat crop was rated as fair or better, while 77 percent or more of pasture land was also similarly rated in all District states. The District's year-to-date coal production for early May was 3.8 percent lower compared with the same period last year. Similarly, the District's coal production for April 2012 was 2.6 percent lower than in April 2011.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|6|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported virtually no change in shipments and just the slightest decline in new orders. Gains continue among the makers of food products, lumber and wood products, fabricated metals, industrial machinery, and instruments. Firms in the primary metals and electronic equipment industries report a fall-off in demand. According to various contacts, growth is attributed to warm weather, automotive demand, production returning from China, Marcellus Shale activity, and renewed customer optimism.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|6|Third District retailers reported that the surprising early sales gains held up through March, then fell back some in April. Year-to-date, gains have remained positive through April. Sunny weather has continued to boost traffic in May; bus counts at outlet malls are nearly double last year's level. Small businesses in less urban markets are struggling as consumers adjust to higher gas prices by cutting retail purchases.  contacts remain cautiously optimistic.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|6|Overall, loan volumes have continued to grow in the Third District since the previous Beige Book. While activity remains uneven, banks report increasing signs of a steady recovery. Loan demand continues to be strongest for inventories and capital equipment to manufacturers and for investments in the higher education, health care, and technology sectors, and in multifamily housing. Most contacts report solid credit quality.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|6|Residential builders report some softening in May traffic and sales due to a combination of typical seasonal slowing and a drop-off from the atypically strong first-quarter sales. Construction crew members for one Pennsylvania builder are working 45 to 70 hours per week; the builder is hiring cautiously as the builder's pace of activity slowly picks up. Residential brokers report "seeing genuine improvement": Year-to-date sales through mid-May exceed last year's and are over plan. A broker reported that much of its workforce operates on a shortened week, and it will exploit this substantial excess capacity before hiring more staff. The outlook among builders and brokers remains positive.
philadelphia|Services|2012|6|Third District service-sector firms have generally reported positive growth since the last Beige Book. Job postings have risen at area universities, local advertising sales have been strong, and area theme parks are attracting increasing numbers of foreign visitors (notably from China). Contacts note little recent change in defense-related activity; however, concerns are mounting that significant federal spending cuts on defense and civil contracts may result from sequestration or its alternative, political compromise. Employers continue to make liberal use of staffing firms; however, staffing contacts report that employers' sense of urgency to fill specific slots is often low. Overall, service-sector firms retain a positive outlook for growth through the remainder of the year.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|6|Price levels have eased slightly since the previous Beige Book and remain generally constrained. Industry contacts indicated that gas prices have stabilized and are expected to ease through the summer. Manufacturing firms report lower cost factors since the last Beige Book. Home builders anticipate cost increases for materials if activity picks up more quickly; however, the current gradual pace of recovery may allow suppliers to adjust without severe cost increases. Retailers and home builders continue to report tight margins. Contacts continue to report a lack of wage pressures, other than for medical benefits. House prices have stabilized in many areas for low-end homes but have fallen further for high-end homes.
summary|Manufacturing|2012|6|continued to expand, and most Districts reported gains in production or new orders. The only exceptions were from the Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis Districts, where factory activity was mixed or had softened slightly. Demand appeared to be the strongest in auto and steel manufacturing. Reports from the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts noted vibrant activity for auto manufacturers, and an auto maker in the Atlanta District reported plans to add a third shift to keep up with increased global demand. Steel manufacturing remained robust, with contacts in the Chicago District reporting the highest capacity utilization rates since the end of the recession and firms in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts noting plans to upgrade or expand operations. Producers of semiconductors and high-tech equipment saw continued growth in orders in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Aircraft and parts makers noted further increases in orders according to reports from Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco, while the Dallas District reported steady demand. Demand for agricultural and construction equipment remained strong according to the Chicago District report, and industrial machinery manufacturers in the Philadelphia District noted gains. Food producers in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts noted solid demand for their products, and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the San Francisco District reported robust activity. Activity at refineries and petrochemical manufacturing facilities expanded further. Demand for construction-related products improved in the Dallas District, and orders for lumber and wood products increased in most reporting Districts.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|6|Retail spending was flat to modestly positive in nearly all Districts. Firms in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts noted sales increased at a more modest pace than in the previous report, as unseasonably warm weather and an earlier Easter holiday had shifted sales into the previous reporting period. By contrast, warm spring weather continued to boost traffic and sales for retailers in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts. Sales of household goods increased in the Boston and Kansas City Districts, and gains in apparel sales were reported by the Boston and Dallas Districts. Sales of big ticket items declined in the Richmond and Chicago Districts, and there were a few reports of high fuel prices affecting consumer spending and sentiment. Inventories were generally at desired levels and were being managed carefully. Outlooks were optimistic, and retailers in several Districts expect modest sales growth in the near term. In particular, contacts in the Kansas City District expect stronger sales growth in coming months, while some retailers in the Chicago District plan to add inventories in expectation of higher back-to-school sales compared with last year.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2012|6|Demand for nonfinancial services was generally stable to slightly stronger since the previous report. Several Districts noted some growth in information technology services, including Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Solid demand for healthcare services was also noted by some Districts.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|6|Activity in residential real estate markets improved in most Districts since the previous report. Several Districts noted consistent indications of recovery in the single-family housing market, although the recovery was characterized as fragile. The apartment market continued to improve, and multifamily construction increased in several Districts.
summary|Banking and Finance|2012|6|Most Districts that commented on lending noted steady or slightly stronger loan demand. Small and medium-sized banks in the New York District reported the most broad-based increase in loan demand since the mid-1990s. Several bankers in the Richmond District said the volume of small business loan applications was markedly higher. Drivers of business loan demand included energy, healthcare, and commercial real estate. Several Districts noted increased demand for capital spending loans.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|6|Agricultural conditions generally improved since the previous report. Rainfall provided much needed moisture in several parts of the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Spring planting and crop emergence was well ahead of the normal pace in most reporting Districts, and corn producers in the Chicago District were hopeful that this promising start may result in a record harvest. Producers in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted that the winter wheat crop was in fair-to-good condition. Farm incomes rose further in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts, and the San Francisco District reported further sales growth for most crop and livestock products. Producers in the Chicago and San Francisco Districts expressed concern that persistent dry conditions may undermine crop production. Although prices of most agricultural commodities declined, hog and cattle prices rose since the previous report.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|6|Hiring was steady or showed a modest increase. Reports of hiring were most prevalent in the manufacturing, construction, information technology, and professional services sectors. Staffing firms in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts noted a pickup in orders, and contacts in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts reported steady growth in orders. Demand for temporary workers rose in the Richmond District, and several employers in the Minneapolis District noted a tightening labor market. New York's report indicated that demand for staffing services was mixed, but manufacturers and other business contacts expect hiring to pick up in coming months. Atlanta's report pointed to positive employment growth in the District. Hiring remained limited in the Chicago District, and modest employment increases were noted in the San Francisco District report. There were widespread reports that firms continued to face difficulty finding highly trained or skilled workers--especially in information technology, engineering, and manufacturing fields--and manufacturers in the Chicago District said they were easing job requirements or using interns to fill open positions. Overall upward wage pressures continued to be fairly modest. There were reports of slight wage increases for skilled workers in the Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco. Contacts in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts noted increases in healthcare costs.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|6|We received mixed signals on manufacturing activity since our last report. According to our latest survey, new orders and shipments were essentially unchanged in May, following solid expansion during the previous month. A producer of metal extrusions reported that, although his sales slowed a bit in April, demand in May picked up again. However, a producer of gas turbines said that economic problems in Europe led to fewer exports, and he expected to lay off ten percent of his employees this summer. Several manufacturers cited decreased government spending as the primary reason for recent cancellations of orders. A manufacturer of aircraft engines expected that cuts in defense spending would soon weaken government demand for his products, but private sector orders remained robust. A spokesperson at another aerospace manufacturing firm said that her business was expanding nicely, and she attributed the increase to strengthening demand for helicopters and gyroplanes. According to our latest survey, both raw materials prices and finished goods prices grew at a somewhat slower pace than a month ago.
richmond|Retail|2012|6|Sales were tepid in recent weeks, after an early Easter pulled some holiday sales into March. Stores reported good Mothers Day sales, although foot traffic was lighter than normal for many retailers. Shopper traffic was unchanged since our last report and big-ticket sales declined, according to a recent survey. A central Virginia retail representative reported little stability in the market as customers exhibited "yo-yo spending" (i.e., up one month, down the next). Accordingly, retailers managed inventories tightly and were reluctant to make capital investments. A South Carolina grocer observed that customers were buying special sale items at different stores, rather than shopping at one store. In contrast, an executive at a chain of hardware stores noted that sales had improved at a slow-but-steady pace since the start of the year. Discount department store managers generally reported a pick-up in sales. For a few discounters, however, the opening of new competition kept sales flat. Automobile sales were also flat. Most home improvement retailers reported a decline in sales in recent weeks. ers' prices rose at a somewhat slower pace since our last report.
richmond|Services|2012|6|Revenues advanced more slowly at services firms since our last report. A building contractor stated that consumers were still avoiding big projects, but were increasingly looking for "more than a coat of paint," as homeowners improved their current homes rather than trying to sell. Several services providers, particularly architectural, engineering, and telecommunication firms, reported stronger revenues. A healthcare provider in Central Virginia reported that demand for in-patient services had flattened out a bit recently, partly due to an absence of influenza cases, but out-patient services were still growing. Several healthcare institutions reported that they were continuing capital spending projects, especially on computer technology, to meet federal requirements and guidelines. Non-retail services providers reported a mild up-tick in the rate of price increases.
richmond|Finance|2012|6|Lending activity increased modestly across most segments of the market. On the commercial side, several bankers cited markedly higher volumes of small business loan applications and increased loan approval rates. One banker attributed the gains to growth in inventory and capital improvement spending, while another said that small businesses were making renovations to commercial properties. However, several loan officers around the District saw little improvement in loan demand from the retail sector. On the consumer side, mortgage demand continued to improve, although refinancing dominated much of the lending. Other bank officials noted solid gains in home improvement loans, with one banker citing an increase in use of equity lines of credit. In contrast to the more upbeat reports, several officials at mid-sized banks described loan demand as flat in recent months, with little new business in the pipeline for either mortgage or commercial loans.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|6|Residential real estate activity generally improved since our last report. A Realtor in the Richmond area, who noted some improvement in April, said that May would be a big indicator of whether the spring market just came early, or if gains would continue into June. He was cautiously optimistic that real estate activity was moving in a positive direction. A source from the Hampton Roads area of Virginia said that housing-related activity in that area had seen recent signs of improvement, adding that properties were being "snapped up" as investors became more confident of a housing recovery and home sellers became more realistic with their prices. Moreover, several brokers in Asheville and Raleigh, North Carolina stated there was an up-tick in housing sales. However, an agent in the Winston-Salem area of the state mentioned that there was still stagnant growth in some areas, and that homes for sale in that area were out of balance with area incomes. Several Realtors reported that sales picked up in recent weeks, while housing prices dropped. Most Realtors indicated that sales were concentrated in the low-to- mid-price range.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|6|Assessments of labor market activity were mixed since our last report. Several employment agency contacts saw somewhat greater demand for temporary workers, and most expected demand to remain strong for the remainder of the year. A Baltimore agent reported an increase in demand for manufacturing workers, adding that manufacturers were hurt by a severe shortage of trained workers. Several contacts said that current hiring was focused on skilled positions, and they expected that companies would continue to experience recruitment problems. However, a representative at a Richmond staffing agency reported that job orders continued to be steady and that more area companies were hiring workers on a permanent basis than a year ago. A source in South Carolina noted that the aerospace industry was investing heavily in new technologies that would reduce the need to hire additional workers. According to our latest survey, District wage gains in manufacturing were slightly lower than a month ago, while the pace of wages in the service sector increased.
richmond|Tourism|2012|6|contacts reported strong bookings during the last four to six weeks, and restaurants in tourist areas experienced solid customer demand. Several hotel owners on the outer banks of North Carolina said that spring got off to a strong start and summer rentals were up. Memorial Day is the traditional summer kick-off for resorts, and most were advertising special events for that weekend. A resort owner in the mountains of Virginia said that he expected a record crowd for the holiday. He added that lower gas prices and good weather boosted bookings in recent weeks, following a winter season with weak demand due to unusually warm weather. In addition, time-share rentals were strong, and booking incentives were no longer necessary.
richmond|Agriculture|2012|6|Rainfall across the District supplied much-needed moisture to emerging field crops. In South Carolina, cotton planting was slightly ahead of schedule, and planting of peanuts was well ahead of its normal pace. However, rainfall delayed plantings of cotton and peanuts in parts of North Carolina and Virginia. Excess precipitation was also problematic for strawberry farmers in Virginia, causing fruit spoilage; the problem was compounded by a lack of pickers. Corn and soybeans began to emerge in Maryland, while farmers in West Virginia reported that warm weather put planting of corn and soybeans ahead of schedule. Lastly, the peach harvest was under way in South Carolina, and cantaloupe and watermelon planting was complete.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|6|Consumer spending increased in the retail, restaurant and tourism sectors but declined in the auto sector. District contacts from every consumer sector expected stronger sales over the next three months. Retailers reported sharply higher sales compared to a month ago. Most product lines experienced gains including home goods such as dining tables, bedroom sets and appliances. Auto sales fell sharply with large SUVs and trucks continuing to be weak sellers. However, most auto contacts remained satisfied with current inventory levels. Restaurant contacts reported increased traffic and higher check amounts. Tourism activity increased in the District due in part to good spring weather. Hotel occupancy held steady as average room rates edged up.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|6|Manufacturing activity in the Tenth District improved in May, and expectations for future activity were stronger than in previous months. Both durable and non-durable goods manufacturers reported increased production. New orders and factory shipments increased during the survey period. Manufacturing contacts reported that capital spending plans were much improved, and several noted plans to expand into new products and markets. Growth in transportation activity was flat, and contacts reported higher input prices. Capital spending plans at transportation firms continued to be sluggish, and firms expected future activity to be unchanged. High-tech services firms reported moderate growth in sales, and expectations for future activity were strong. Several high-tech firms reported difficulty in finding experienced workers, especially qualified software developers.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|6|Residential real estate activity improved during the most recent survey period, and commercial activity was solid. Housing starts were down compared to the previous survey, but builders expected new home construction to increase over the next three months. Housing materials were readily available, but several respondents had trouble finding skilled workers. Sales activity at construction supply firms surged during the survey period across all types of materials, and expectations for sales continued to be strong. Residential sales were much improved from the previous survey, and inventories continued to fall. Contacts reported that homes priced between $150,000 and $300,000 sold particularly well, but homes at the upper end of the market continued to be difficult to sell. Overall mortgage lending activity grew this survey period, but refinancing activity was flat. The majority of refinancing activity was due to lower payments in response to low interest rates. Commercial real estate activity was solid during the survey period, but there was some uncertainty about future activity. Vacancy rates fell, and contacts expected them to continue to fall over the next three months. Prices and rents were flat, but expectations were for some increases in the future. Several respondents believed that political uncertainty could create some weakness in the construction and commercial real estate markets.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|6|In the recent survey period, bankers generally reported slightly stronger loan demand, improving loan quality, and increased deposits. Overall loan demand was improving as most respondents reported stable to increased loan demand for residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and commercial real estate loans. Demand for consumer installment loans remained steady. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and the majority of respondents reported steady or increased deposits. Most bankers reported improving loan quality compared to a year ago. Additionally, every banker believed the outlook for loan quality over the next six months would be steady or improving.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|6|Agricultural conditions improved since the last survey. District contacts reported that winter wheat development was roughly three weeks ahead of normal. Most of the winter wheat was rated in fair-to-good condition. Spring planting was nearly complete, and early emerged crops were rated in good condition. Tight crop supplies kept cash prices high, while the prospects of a bumper 2012 crop weighed on futures prices. High feeder calf prices continued to support strong profits for ranchers. In contrast, profits at cattle feedlots were strained by high feed and feeder calf costs. Strong export demand underpinned profits for pork producers. Farmland values rose further, buoyed by farm incomes and revenues from mineral rights leases.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|6|activity continued to expand in May. Drilling activity increased since the previous survey. However, contacts reported that storage reservoirs were full and that an oversupply of natural gas was beginning to result in a slowdown in the pace of drilling. Oil prices fell during the survey period, and contacts believed that a slumping world economy would keep prices steady over the next three months. Natural gas prices rose somewhat but remained near historically low levels, and contacts expected prices to stay low due to oversupply. Firms reported that they would like to expand their workforces in the coming months, but noted that it had been difficult to find experienced field workers and engineers.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|6|District contacts reported higher prices for both inputs and finished goods, and wage pressures increased from low levels. Manufacturers continued to report higher raw material prices, but prices increased at a slower pace than earlier this year. Finished goods prices rose slightly in April and were flat in May. Manufacturers expected higher prices for both raw materials and finished goods over the next six months although the number of contacts expecting an increase fell slightly. Builders reported higher input prices, and retailers reported higher sales prices. Both builders and retailers expected further increases over the next three months. Higher food costs and menu prices were noted by restaurant contacts who also anticipated raising menu prices further as food prices continue to rise. Wage pressures increased since the previous survey but remained fairly low. The number of contacts reporting labor shortages remained stable, but contacts reported difficulty in filling a variety of positions including housekeeping, sales, drivers, mechanics, engineers, and skilled workmen.

san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|9|Upward price pressures were very limited on net during the reporting period. Further modest price declines were noted for energy inputs and some raw materials. Stiff competition among domestic firms, combined with weak final demand, resulted in largely stable prices for most categories of final goods and services. The primary reported exceptions were clothing and medical care, for which recent cost increases were passed through to final prices.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|9|Retail sales were mixed but rose a bit overall. For general merchandise such as apparel and smaller household items, contacts reported modest improvements in sales, with stronger performance for traditional department stores than for discount chains. By contrast, retailers of major appliances and furniture reported weaker demand resulting from a renewed sense of caution on the part of consumers. Grocery sales were largely flat. Sales of new automobiles improved somewhat, despite ongoing shortages of parts and assembled vehicles for some brands arising from the natural disaster in Japan earlier this year. The demand for used vehicles continued to firm, with contacts noting rising sales and additional upward pressure on prices and trade-in values.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|9|District manufacturing activity was mixed but appeared to grow slightly during the reporting period of mid-July through the end of August. Although manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products reported slower growth for new orders and sales, capacity utilization rates remained high and inventories were near desired levels given the pace of sales. For makers of commercial aircraft, significant increases in new orders for narrow-body aircraft combined with an existing order backlog to keep production rates near capacity. A metal fabricator noted that sales were "steady but slow"and raw materials were readily available. Petroleum refiners reported slightly weaker demand and capacity utilization rates that were largely stable, causing product inventories to rise somewhat. Demand held at very low levels for manufacturers of wood products.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|9|Demand grew further for agricultural products and metals but was down slightly for natural resources used for energy production. Orders and sales continued to expand for a wide variety of crop and livestock products, especially cattle and cotton. Contacts noted that agricultural input costs have stabilized following significant increases in the spring. Rising sales prices for assorted metals spurred further increases in mining activity in parts of the District. Overall demand for crude oil weakened a bit, primarily reflecting weaker domestic demand, but extraction activity for natural gas was largely unchanged.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|9|Demand for housing and for commercial real estate was little changed from existing low levels. Although the reports pointed to scattered signs of improvement in the entry-level and high-end segments of the District's housing markets, the pace of home sales and construction remained depressed. By contrast, demand for rental space continued to grow, enabling landlords to increase rents and scale back tenant concessions in some areas. Demand for commercial real estate remained weak overall, and vacancy rates for office and industrial space stayed elevated throughout the District. Conditions were mixed across geographic markets, with deterioration in leasing activity for some areas contrasting with ongoing improvements in areas that have benefited from growth in the technology sector, such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|9|Reports from District banking contacts indicated that loan demand was largely stable to marginally down compared with the prior reporting period. Citing heightened levels of uncertainty, some businesses showed a reduced desire to engage in expansionary capital spending, reportedly causing demand for commercial and industrial loans to weaken slightly. Contacts in most sectors reported downward revisions to their expectations for growth in their industry for the remainder of the year, suggesting that capital spending will remain muted in coming months. On the consumer side, loan demand was largely unchanged. While lending standards remained relatively restrictive for business and consumer loans, the reports pointed to ongoing improvements in overall credit quality and some loosening of credit standards for selected borrowers.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2011|9|Year to date through early August, contacted First District retailers report generally flat sales compared to a year earlier. Reports range from down 5 percent to up almost 4 percent. Consumers are conservative in the purchases they are making and, in particular, are avoiding big-ticket items. Sales of furniture and office supplies have been sluggish, while apparel and home improvement categories have performed a bit better. One contact saw a pronounced downward sales trend in recent weeks that he attributes to consumer concerns about the debt ceiling debate, stock market gyrations, ongoing high unemployment, and continuing unease about the U.S. economy's medium-term prospects. Some contacts are hiring, but most are cautious about adding to head count and one may have layoffs after the holidays. Retailers say that commodity price increases have moderated. Inventory levels are being positioned for an uncertain economic environment. All respondents voice concern that the economic outlook is sluggish for the foreseeable future; they are scaling back capital spending plans for 2012.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|9|Manufacturing contacts report relatively mixed business conditions, especially compared to the widespread favorable reports earlier this year. Some firms cite flatter and/or slower revenue growth in the current quarter compared to the first half of the year, while others say sales growth continues to be relatively robust. Semiconductor-related manufacturers in particular note declines in demand, although they attribute it to standard demand cycles for their products, given the surge in purchasing they saw in late 2010 and early 2011. A diversified manufacturer and a company in the aerospace industry also report somewhat softening demand, which they attribute to a possible end to the post-recession sales bounce-back as well as increased economic uncertainty making some customers less willing to stockpile inventory. A number of firms also note a slowdown in European demand for their products. By contrast, sales growth at pharmaceutical companies remains steady, and demand at various industrial supply manufacturers continues to be strong. Contacts at these industrial products firms note that they have little lead time between orders and sales and thus they would know very quickly if demand were slowing. Despite continued favorable conditions at some companies, nearly all manufacturing contacts voice concern regarding the current state of economic uncertainty and more than one commented that the country is "talking itself into a recession."Some respondents continue to postpone hiring and/or investment to keep costs low while others report having contingency plans in place should demand turn down noticeably.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2011|9|New England software and information technology contacts report that the upward trends of 2010 and early 2011 continued through the end of the second quarter. Year-over-year revenue increases, ranging from 4 percent to 30 percent, were driven by notable increases in both software license sales and recurring service revenues. Reports on activity since July are mixed, however, with some contacts experiencing downticks and others posting larger-than-expected increases. Headcounts continue to rise in line with revenue growth, although many contacts report increasing difficulty in finding qualified software engineers, programmers, and sales personnel. As a result, some have bolstered their recruitment efforts and one contact has added jobs overseas. Wages are steady or up slightly, with annual merit increases generally in the 3 percent to 5 percent range. Selling prices have been left unchanged as a result of a competitive market environment. The outlook among New England software and IT services respondents is not appreciably different from that of 3 months ago, with most expecting growth in late 2011 and early 2012 to be in the 10 percent to 20 percent range.
boston|Staffing Services|2011|9|Nearly all New England staffing contacts report upticks in business volume through the end of second quarter and into the third; however, many respondents lament that overall activity remains below expectations. Revenues are flat to increasing year-over-year, with increases in the range of 5 percent to 25 percent. Labor demand continues to strengthen, albeit modestly, with notable improvements in the manufacturing and information technology sectors. Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring continues to grow; indeed, two contacts report that permanent placements are up more than 20 percent relative to last year. Notwithstanding stronger demand, jobs remain difficult to fill as clients remain fastidious in their candidate expectations. One contact notes that jobs that used to take just a few days to fill continue to take weeks. Supply of high-end labor remains tight in the region, but there has been no significant change since May. Bill rates and pay rates are steady. Looking forward, New England staffing contacts are generally less upbeat than they were three and six months ago, with many expecting to "move sideways" into 2012.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|9|Commercial leasing fundamentals are roughly unchanged since the last report. Office leasing activity was stable in Boston but resulted in no significant absorption or changes in rental rates. In Hartford, the modest momentum observed in the first half stalled as sentiment turned negative, and the risk of a significant slowdown in leasing and sales activity in the fourth quarter is considered high. Investor demand for prime office and apartment buildings in Greater Boston remains strong, raising concern among some contacts that sales prices are moving too high relative to rents and occupancy. The lending environment for commercial real estate in Boston is characterized by aggressive competition among banks, resulting in downward pressure on mortgage rates. Looking forward, relatively weak office-leasing demand in Boston is expected to persist in light of recently-announced layoffs at a few large downtown employers.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|9|States throughout New England experienced increases in home sales in July compared to last year; however, contacts express little enthusiasm about these increases because they largely reflect struggling sales activity following the expiration of the homebuyers' tax credit last year rather than any improvement in activity this year. Respondents report that activity in the housing market remains sluggish, with potential buyers remaining apprehensive about economic conditions. The median sale price of single-family homes and condos remained close to even with a year ago throughout much of the region. Contacts report sellers pricing competitively in order to attract bids and buyers negotiating even lower prices. Meanwhile, listings continue to climb in the region, but most contacts did not express serious concern about the level of inventory reached.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|9|Consumer spending increased moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in July increased over 4 percent compared with a year earlier. Two Minnesota restaurant and bar chains reported that recent sales were up modestly from last year. A North Dakota mall manager reported that sales and traffic were steadily up during July and August compared with a year ago. After a relatively soft July, sales and traffic picked up by mid-August at a South Dakota mall. Bank directors noted that luxury goods showed signs of strength, such as sales of jewelry and high-end vehicles.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|9|Commercial construction activity has increased slightly since the last report. Respondents to a mid-August Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey reported an increase in revenues, primarily due to a number of small commercial retrofitting projects in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Rebuilding in flood-damaged areas was also mentioned. However, the value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was down slightly in July from July 2010. Residential construction increased from last year. The value of residential building permits in July increased significantly from the same period a year earlier in both the Sioux Falls and Minneapolis-St. Paul areas.
minneapolis|Services|2011|9|On balance, professional business services firms reported flat activity over the past three months. A third of services firms that responded to the ad hoc survey saw increased sales, while a third saw decreased sales. Respondents noted that profits were also flat, but they expect increased activity over the next three months. An information technology company noted that July sales were down due to reduced demand from the government and financial services areas.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|9|activity increased slightly. A July survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and South Dakota, but declined slightly in North Dakota. A metal fabricator announced plans to expand a facility in northwestern Montana. Nearly three-quarters of manufacturing respondents to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey indicated that their sales increased in the past three months, and 60 percent expect them to increase in the next three months.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|9|Activity in the energy and mining sectors continued at strong levels since the last report. Late-August oil exploration activity increased from mid-July. Iron ore shipments from District mines increased 18 percent in July from a year earlier, according to a Great Lakes shipping organization. Activity at Montana mines remains strong, driven by high metals prices, according to contacts.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|9|Ninth District agricultural production is expected to decrease from last year, while prices remain strong. Montana and North Dakota durum wheat production estimates for 2011 were down a combined 57 percent from 2010, according to the U.S. Department of . Spring wheat and soybean production estimates for District states were down 18 percent and 10 percent, respectively. In contrast, District corn production estimates increased about 5 percent over last year. Prices for many District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including corn, soybeans, wheat, dairy, cattle and hogs; poultry prices decreased recently.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|9|Reports from labor markets include a mix of layoffs and new hiring. During a 20-day Minnesota government shutdown in July, 22,000 government employees were out of work. By delaying state funding and inspections, the shutdown also idled many construction projects across Minnesota. A bank recently announced plans to cut nearly 150 employees at its brokerage unit in Minneapolis. However, during July, Minnesota gained 8,200 private sector jobs. Minnesota auto dealers have started to hire more sales staff. About 11,000 new jobs related to oil drilling are expected in North Dakota, according to an announcement by a firm with operations there. According to the ad hoc survey, 19 percent of respondents expect to increase employment over the next three months, while 10 percent expect to decrease employment. A new fabrication plant in Montana will lead to 100 more jobs, and a sporting goods manufacturer in Minnesota announced plans to add 100 jobs over the next two years.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|9|Production at District factories was stable during the past six weeks, although reports indicated declines in new orders and backlogs. Many of our contacts expect additional slowing in demand, which they attributed to uncertainty and caution on the part of their customers. Almost all steel producers and service centers reported that the weakening in shipping volume that began during the second quarter has continued. However, some of our contacts are looking for a pickup in new orders due to low supply chain inventories. Steel shipments are being driven primarily by transportation- and energy-related industries. District auto production decreased in July on a month-over-month basis, due to normal seasonal retooling for model changeovers. Year-over-year production also fell, but declines were limited to foreign nameplates, as supply disruptions caused by events in Japan persist.
cleveland|Construction|2011|9|Single-family home construction remains at a low level, with purchases mainly in the move-up buyer categories. Contractors reported that a lack of confidence is keeping potential buyers on the side-lines, even with mortgage interest rates at very low levels. A few of our contacts noted that multi-family construction and remodeling now accounts for a substantial part of their backlogs. Expectations call for little change in residential building in the near term. List prices of new homes held steady, while builders shifted away from discounting. The upward pressure on building material prices that was seen in early summer has diminished. Two builders reported some easing in credit restrictions for financing multi-family and spec construction. Aggressive pricing on the part of subcontractors was widespread. One contact reported that monies from the 2009 stimulus package earmarked for home weatherization programs have been exhausted, which could lead to further job cutbacks in residential construction. General contractors continue to work with lean crews.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|9|Retailers reported that sales for the period from early July through mid-August were on or ahead of plan, and that transactions increased in single-digits relative to year-ago levels. Many of our contacts said that rising sales included necessities and discretionary items, especially for new and innovative products. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, most contacts expect their sales to rise in the low- to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. However, grocers we spoke with anticipate little improvement in sales volume for the remainder of this year. We continue to hear about upward pressure on supplier prices, although it mainly affects meat and dairy products and items produced from cotton. Retailers attributed some of the pressure to higher costs for transportation, packaging, and certain commodities. Grocers passed through the increases to their customers, while other retailers were more selective in adjusting prices. Reports on profit margins were mixed. Capital outlays remain on plan. Half of our contacts said that they are in the process of expanding the number of their retail outlets. However, no change in payrolls is expected at existing stores.
cleveland|Banking|2011|9|Overall demand for business loans showed a modest improvement, with requests coming from a broad range of industries. Reports indicated downward pressure on interest rates for business credit. Consumer credit was driven by indirect auto lending and home equity lines of credit. Other installment loan categories remained weak. Applications for residential mortgages have picked up, with bankers citing falling interest rates as the reason. Submissions were fairly mixed but leaned toward refinancing. Core deposits continued to increase, driven by inflows from business customers. Several bankers commented that the rate of growth in consumer deposits has weakened. Credit standards were largely unchanged. Delinquencies declined across all loan categories. No significant changes in employment levels were cited, and little new hiring is expected in the near-term.
cleveland|Energy|2011|9|Conventional oil and natural gas drilling and production were stable during the past six weeks, while activity in Marcellus and Utica shales continued to expand. Shale gas produced in Pennsylvania grew by almost 60 percent in the first six months of 2011 relative to the prior six-month period. Wellhead prices paid to independent producers declined slightly. Little change in coal output is anticipated for the remainder of this year. Rising demand for coal in overseas markets has been offset by a lessening in demand from domestic utilities and production constraints due to increased governmental oversight in permitting and environmental compliance. Spot prices for coal increased between 1 percent and 3 percent. Capital outlays are on target, with moderate increases projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming months for drilling new wells. The cost of production equipment and materials was fairly stable; however, prices increased for tubular products and tires. A modest rise in payrolls was reported.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|9|Overall, freight transport volume continued on a slight upward trend, although a few of our contacts characterized volume over the past couple of months as inconsistent. As a result, they revised their near-term growth projections down slightly. Several respondents have successfully increased their shipping rates as customer contracts came up for renewal. Prices for diesel fuel have been trending lower, while maintenance costs are rising, especially for tires. Capital outlays have accelerated during 2011 relative to prior-year levels. Spending is mainly to replace aging transport equipment and to support demand growth from energy customers. Hiring has been largely for driver replacement; however, we heard two reports about carriers adding capacity. Wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|9|Most District merchants reported that retail sales growth had slowed in July and August. Businesses noted a drop in sales and traffic compared with a year ago. The majority of contacts stated that they were keeping inventory levels lean and had no plans to increase supply in the near term. The outlook among most retailers was less optimistic than earlier in the year, although some contacts noted that the costs of cotton-based inputs for the spring selling season will not be as high as initially feared.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|9|The majority of District residential brokers reported that sales were slightly ahead of last year's weak levels. Most of the increase came from Florida contacts, although several brokers there stated that a decline in bank-owned homes available to purchase had held sales back somewhat. Outside Florida, brokers found that sales were similar to last year's levels. The majority of brokers indicated that housing inventories remained elevated. Brokers continued to note downward pressure on home prices with most indicating that prices were flat to slightly down compared with a year ago. The outlook weakened over the reporting period with most contacts anticipating sales growth to be down slightly over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|9|Manufacturers indicated that the level of new orders and production increased in mid-July and August, but at a slower pace than earlier this year. A leading auto dealer and many parts suppliers felt that the impact of supply disruptions from Japan had ended. A large tire manufacturer noted particular pressure in meeting a recent surge in orders as the supply chain normalized from the disaster in Japan. Many manufacturers reported increased investment in technology equipment in efforts to increase efficiency.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|9|Bankers noted ongoing weakness in loan demand as both consumers and businesses were restrained in borrowing activity. Credit standards at banks and credit unions were little-changed and some firms, such as newer businesses or those related to real estate, reported difficulty obtaining loans. Contacts at large companies indicated they did not have many issues with credit availability. Many mentioned self-funding capital projects through the use of cash reserves or retained earnings. Some businesses signaled that they did not need additional credit, but had access to funds while others with financial issues struggled to get bank credit.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|9|Most businesses reported muted hiring activity. Many held the view that sales are the key factor in determining labor demand, and uncertainty about future sales seems to be exacerbating firms' unwillingness to commit to full-time employees. Hence, companies continued to hire temporary workers and contractors and are delaying longer-term projects. Many noted focusing on efficiency and productivity increases with existing staff to meet current or any seasonal increase in demand. Wage increases were reportedly subdued, with many business contacts opting for cash bonuses and restoration of benefits over annual salary increases.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|9|The number of oil and gas rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico has continued its gradual ascent in recent months. However, the current rig count is only about two-thirds of the number of offshore rigs in operation before the spring 2010 Gulf oil spill. Despite the recent decline in oil prices, contacts in the energy equipment fabrication business reported ongoing backlogs in orders for pipelines, supply boats, and drilling equipment. Energy producers are moving forward with plans to invest in increased oil production capacity.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|9|Non-auto retail sales continued to run close to or slightly ahead of plan in July, with same-store sales on par with or slightly ahead of a year earlier. Most retailers indicate modest slowing in the first three weeks of August, although one major mall in western New York State notes some firming in sales activity in August, following a sluggish July. Widespread disruptions from Hurricane Irene across much of the District are likely to adversely affect sales tallies for the full month, but replacement of consumers' water-damaged property is expected to boost sales in September. Retail prices are reported to be mostly stable, though some retailers are implementing moderate increases on prices of cotton-based merchandise to counter sharply rising costs. Inventories are generally reported to be in good shape.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|9|Residential construction and home sales have remained sluggish but generally steady since the last report, while there has been further improvement in the rental market. Overall, prices of existing homes have edged up in recent months in many areas but are still down slightly from a year ago across most of the region. Buffalo-area Realtors report that market conditions remained weak in July and early August, with the median selling price little changed from a year earlier, but that a recent increase in pending sales suggests some recent firming in market conditions. An authority on New Jersey's housing industry reports that a large overhang of distressed properties continues to weigh down the market but that the processing of foreclosures is now resuming; this is expected to lower reported transaction prices, on average, but increase sales activity and gradually reduce the inventory. New construction activity is very low and largely concentrated in the multi-family (rental) segment. A major appraisal firm reports a more-than-typical seasonal drop-off in activity in New York City's co-op and condo market in August; some of the recent softness is deemed to reflect concern about the city's financial sector. Still, the markets in Manhattan and nearby Brooklyn are reported to be holding up relatively well, buoyed, in part, by foreign buyers paying cash. New York City's rental market has shown continued strength: the inventory of available units is down moderately, and rents on new leases continue to climb and are up 5 to 8 percent over the past year.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|9|Reports from business contacts point to some weakening in general business activity and steady to weakening conditions in the labor market. A major New York City employment agency reports that hiring activity has been unusually slow in August but remains cautiously optimistic that recruitment will pick up after Labor Day; financial firms, in particular, have become more hesitant and even hiring for compliance jobs has slowed. Separately, a contact in the securities industry reports that widespread layoffs are planned across the industry (though not entirely in New York City) and not all the weakness is related to the current market turmoil. There continues to be some hiring in compliance and technology, but layoffs now exceed hiring, on net.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|9|Bankers indicate weakening demand for consumer loans and commercial & industrial loans, but an increase in the demand for residential mortgages, as well as for refinancing. Bankers report tightening their standards for commercial mortgages and commercial & industrial loans but no change in credit standards for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Respondents report a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--most notably commercial mortgages. Respondents also indicated a decrease in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers report increased delinquency rates on all categories of loans except commercial & industrial loans. The increase in delinquency was most widespread for consumer loans where 41 percent of respondents indicated increases in delinquency rates and only 7 percent indicated decreases.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|9|Consumer spending was little changed on balance from the previous reporting period. Retailers reported the back-to-school shopping season got off to a strong start. Consumers responded more than expected to the increase in early back-to-school promotions on items such as apparel, and expanded their purchases even on non-back-to-school items. Spending on luxury goods also increased in July, but slowed noticeably in early August. Contacts noted that rising uncertainty about the economic outlook and stock market volatility had led to a decline in consumer confidence, pointing to lower customer traffic in August. Vehicle sales edged up in July before leveling off in August. A contact in the auto industry reported that many consumers were still waiting for Japanese products to become more readily available before making a purchase decision. Spending on other consumer durables like furniture and appliances remained weak.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|9|Business spending continued at a slow, but steady, pace in July and August. Some manufacturers reported proceeding as planned with capital expenditures and labor force additions to alleviate pressures on capacity. In contrast, contacts mentioned that lower expectations for farm income had slowed purchases of farm equipment. Several contacts also noted closely watching inventory and staffing levels in the event that increases in uncertainty in the economic outlook and financial market volatility took a toll on demand. A retail contact indicated that holiday inventories will likely be higher this year because retailers had been very optimistic at the time the orders were made. Labor market conditions weakened, with hiring still slow and unemployment edging up in the District. In addition, a large staffing firm reported a decline in billable hours for staffing and professional services as well as fewer permanent placements.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2011|9|Construction activity softened in July and August. Residential real estate conditions remained weak. There was little new single-family home construction during the reporting period. Builder showroom traffic declined, as contacts noted an inability to maintain the slight momentum they had seen early in the summer sales season. Nonresidential construction also fell overall. Public construction work slowed some and commercial construction remained low. In contrast, contacts noted continued strength in demand for industrial construction, particularly from the automotive sector, and a slight uptick in demand from the retail sector. Commercial real estate conditions were little changed, with vacancy rates steady and downward pressure on rents.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|9|production appeared to have settled down to a slower pace of expansion in August after experiencing some volatility in output during July. Demand for heavy equipment moderated from its robust pace during the first half of the year. However, contacts noted as reasons for its expected continued strength robust activity in the energy and mining sectors, pending regulatory emissions requirements, low dealer inventories, a lack of used equipment, and an aging rental fleet. Auto production increased in July before leveling off in August, as inventories returned to more comfortable levels. District automakers also reported no change in production plans, despite concerns about the recently slower gains in sales. Capacity utilization in the steel industry remained at a record high level, with order books solid and steel service center inventories still tight. Manufacturers of industrial metals cited a significant softening in orders for near-term delivery, but a pick-up in recent weeks in higher volume, longer-lead time orders. In contrast, shipments of household appliances and construction materials continued to decline.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|9|Credit conditions tightened moderately over the course of the reporting period. Volatility in financial markets increased dramatically in early August. Contacts cited S&P's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, increased concerns about a European sovereign debt default, and reduced expectations for growth in the second half of the year as reasons for the increase in volatility. Corporate funding costs moved higher as a flight to quality caused credit spreads to increase. Business loan demand fell, with bank contacts indicating that heightened uncertainty had led many customers to adopt a "wait-and-see"attitude. Private equity investment also slowed. On the supply side, the availability of commercial and industrial credit continued to improve both for large and small borrowers, with stiff competition for the highest quality customers. Some traditional real estate lenders were reportedly moving into the commercial and industrial market, increasing competition and further lowering the cost of capital for these borrowers. That said, contacts expressed concern that recently announced layoffs at several large commercial banks and declining bank stock prices do not bode well for future credit availability.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|9|Elevated commodity prices continued to put pressure on costs in July and August. While prices for industrial metals like copper and steel eased some, they are still elevated. In addition, several manufacturers reported extended material lead times, particularly for specialty metals. Energy prices also moved lower, but contacts indicated that these lower prices have not yet been reflected in reduced fuel surcharges. In contrast, food prices continued to rise. Manufacturers and retailers both indicated a high rate of pass-through to downstream prices. Wage pressures remained moderate, but a few contacts noted that wages were starting to increase.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|9|Corn and soybean crop conditions declined markedly in the primary production areas of the District due to hot temperatures and a lack of precipitation during July and August. Reports that lower quality corn was being used to produce biofuel despite its higher production costs were indicative of just how low stocks have fallen. Cash prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat rose during the reporting period. Ethanol plants were pushing up the bidding for corn to be used in fall production. Hot weather stressed animals, lowering the output of meat and dairy products. Hog prices set nominal records, while milk and cattle prices moved up as well. Sale prices for farmland continued to move higher.
dallas|Prices|2011|9|Overall, prices were unchanged from the last report, although there were some reports of price increases. Food producers noted a continued rise in commodity prices, particularly for corn. Accounting, legal and staffing firms reported slight increases in rates charged for their services, and airlines noted fare increases in the high single digits compared to last year's levels. Contacts in rail transportation said they had rolled back some earlier instituted increases in shipping rates, and airlines and cargo service firms reported benefitting from lower fuel prices. Retailers noted slight declines in overall prices, although increases were seen for high-end goods and certain products affected by higher cotton prices.
dallas|Labor Market|2011|9|Most responding firms reported steady employment levels, and some noted slight hiring activity. Staffing firms continued to see steady demand at high levels. Most transportation equipment, food and metals manufacturers reported an increase in payrolls, and some said they had increased work hours as well. A few contacts at legal services, auto sales, energy, and transportation service firms reported modest employment increases. Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure was noted by one transportation equipment manufacturer.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|9|Reports from construction-related manufacturers were mixed, but suggest overall activity levels were unchanged. Manufacturers tied to residential construction generally reported continued sluggish demand. Primary metals manufacturers saw a broad-based increase in activity, and producers of lumber and wood products noted a pickup in demand partly due to remodeling projects. Construction-related outlooks remained weak, and some contacts expressed concern about the uncertainty surrounding the national economy and lack of sufficient backlogs.
dallas|Retail Sales|2011|9|Retail demand was unchanged since the last report, but sales rose in the mid-to-low single digits from a year ago. Back-to school sales activity picked up slightly. Apparel, especially women's clothing, and fine jewelry are segments that have shown strength recently. There is some concern regarding recent stock market volatility and its potential impact on consumer confidence, but this has not affected store activity, reported contacts. Sales in Texas and the Southwest region continued to outpace those nationwide by a slim margin, according to two large retailers, and expectations are for continued modest growth through year-end.
dallas|Services|2011|9|Overall demand for staffing services held steady at high levels, although several firms noted slight declines in activity. One contact reported that temporary placements were being outpaced by direct hiring activity. Outlooks were more cautious than the previous reporting period, with contacts expecting demand to remain flat or decline through year-end. Demand for accounting services was flat, although contacts noted some strength in mergers and acquisitions activity. Legal firms reported continued solid demand for intellectual property, energy, IPO, and mergers and acquisitions services.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2011|9|Contacts in the single-family housing industry said new and existing home sales rose slightly since the last report, although the market remains weak overall. Existing home inventories declined and new home inventories remained lean. Respondents are cautious in their outlooks, but most expect a slight improvement in sales in the second half of the year, with a slow recovery taking hold by early 2012.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|9|Most financial firms reported relatively flat loan demand, with the exception of one contact who noted a slowdown in lending activity. Contacts at national banks said they are concerned about the loss of momentum for a self-sustaining recovery and are seeing customers approach borrowing decisions conservatively. Regional banks said loan pricing remained aggressive. Outlooks are generally less optimistic than the prior reporting period, although outstanding loan quality remains stable and there continues to be gradual improvement in lending conditions.
dallas|Energy|2011|9|Texas drilling activity rose since the last report, with the state adding 43 rigs over the past six weeks. Most of the demand is from land-based drilling, led by horizontal drilling and fracturing. Initially applied to natural gas formations, success is growing in application of these technologies to oil basins, such as the Permian Basin. Contacts noted that activity in the Gulf of Mexico remained weak, with only a few recent permits approved for drilling.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|9|Drought conditions remain severe and agricultural losses in the state have reached $5.2 billion, surpassing the 2006 record of $4.1 billion, according to Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates. Dry weather and high temperatures have reduced yields and increased abandonment of crops. The livestock sector has also suffered greatly, with very poor grazing conditions necessitating costly supplemental feeding and in many cases the selling off of herds. An increase in the number of cows and calves being sold has dampened cattle prices. Grain prices have generally increased since the last report, partly driven by lower production expectations. Strong export demand for beef has benefitted the district's livestock sector.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2011|9|Contacts reported that retail sales in July and early August were down slightly, on average, over year-earlier levels. About 29 percent of the retailers saw increases in sales, while half saw decreases and 21 percent saw no changes. Roughly 48 percent of the retailers reported that sales levels were below their expectations, 43 percent reported that sales met expectations, and 9 percent reported that sales were above expectations. About 29 percent of the retailers reported that their inventories were too high, while 17 percent reported that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook for September and October was mixed: About 42 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2010 levels, while 29 percent expect sales to decrease and 29 percent expect sales to be similar to those of last year.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|9|Manufacturing activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or reduce operations. Firms in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; art goods; packaging; bioscience; power hand tools; and sanitary paper products manufacturing industries reported plans to expand operations and hire new workers. In contrast, firms in the appliance and burial casket manufacturing industries announced plans to close plants and lay off employees.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|9|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, July 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 8 percent in Memphis, 13 percent in St. Louis, 14 percent in Louisville, and 15 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction also continued to decrease throughout the District. July 2011 year-to-date single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 18 percent in Memphis, 21 percent in Louisville, 26 percent in Little Rock, and 28 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|9|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks indicated a modest increase in overall lending activity during the three-month period ending in July. Credit standards for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately stronger. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were also unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans were unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Credit standards for residential mortgage loans ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger, while demand for these loans was mixed, ranging from moderately weaker to moderately stronger.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|9|The fraction of pastures in fair or better condition has declined in most District states except Mississippi since the previous report. Crop production has been mixed in the District. Corn, cotton, and sorghum production increased from 2010 to 2011, while rice and soybean production fell by at least 5.7 percent. The fraction of corn, sorghum, and soybean crops rated as fair or better has fallen, while the fraction of cotton and rice crops similarly rated has risen since the previous report. Year-to-date coal production at the end of July for the Eighth District was 4 percent higher in 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. Meanwhile, monthly production for July 2011 was 7.8 percent lower than July 2010.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|9|Since the last Beige Book, the percent of Third District manufacturers reporting decreases in new orders and shipments has risen substantially, while the percent reporting increases has fallen slightly. The general decline in activity was not uniform across sectors. The makers of food products, fabricated metals, and electronic equipment reported declining product demand. However, growing product demand was reported by printers and publishers, by makers of instruments, and by lumber and wood products manufacturers. Shipments increased, but orders fell for firms reporting in the primary metals and industrial machinery sectors. Firms experiencing growth cited foreign markets, growing market share, and product shifts as positive factors. Declining demand was attributed to sluggish residential construction, softening domestic consumption, and the falloff in public infrastructure spending. One industrial supply firm indicated steady growth overall but noted some softness in sales to those manufacturers most sensitive to business cycles.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|9|Third District retailers reported that sales were generally flat to down compared with a year earlier, although results were more varied among individual stores across the District. Heavy promotions and markdowns have been deployed to counter what one retail manager described as "not a great August." ers are looking forward to the extended holiday shopping season with hopeful optimism.
philadelphia|Finance|2011|9|Third District banks contacted in August indicated soft loan demand, although some bank contacts cited strengths in small business lending, and in lending to development projects for apartment rentals, hotels, and commercial retail. More generally, commercial and industrial loan volumes grew, while consumer and commercial real estate loan volumes shrank. On balance, total credit extended by banks in the Third District has been generally flat since the last Beige Book. Most banks report improving credit quality, while credit standards have changed little. Bank contacts report lowering their expectations for the remainder of the year--anticipating little growth for all of 2011.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|9|Residential real estate activity in the Third District has slowed slightly since the previous Beige Book. Agents reported little traffic and have revised their plans downward for the remainder of the year. A backlog of foreclosures, the volume of which was especially large in New Jersey, and flat to slightly falling house prices continue to dampen demand for new and used homes. Some builders reported signs of strengthening from mid-July to August, then as financial market volatility increased, a few deals unwound and traffic ground to a halt. "You could hear the crickets for two weeks," said one builder, reflecting on the anemic growth even for a typically slow August. An uptick in refinances was reported; however, little of the resulting consumer savings is expected to impact housing.
philadelphia|Services|2011|9|Reports from Third District service-sector firms remain generally positive, but with greater expressions of uncertainty. A logistics firm described business as surprisingly strong--improving since the last Beige Book and better than last year. Staffing firms noted an increase in temporary hiring to fill permanent positions--indicating increased uncertainty among their customers. In addition to the impact from anticipated troop reductions, defense-related firms noted concerns stemming from the debt-ceiling agreement. While growth remains generally steady, greater uncertainty has crept into the generally positive outlook of service-sector firms.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|9|Since the previous Beige Book, the percent of manufacturers reporting increases in prices paid for inputs has continued to fall slightly from one-third to one-fourth. Over the same period, the percent reporting decreases in prices received for their own products rose slightly from one-sixth to over one-fifth. Since the last Beige Book, commodity price pressures have lessened somewhat on retailers, service-sector firms, and builders; however, margins remain very tight. But for a few business sectors or a few scattered rental markets, there are scant reports of upward pressure on rents and wages.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|9|Overall consumer spending increased slightly in most Districts, but non-auto retail sales were flat or down in some Districts. Hurricane Irene evacuations also produced widespread retail disruptions in late August in the New York District, where activity had been close to or above plan in July before slowing somewhat in early August. The Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported moderate increases in non-auto retail sales during the survey period, and sales in the San Francisco District were mixed but up slightly overall. Retail sales were up single-digits from a year ago in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, although Dallas reported no growth in sales since the previous survey period. Retailers in the Chicago District reported strong back to school sales, while Atlanta said growth slowed in retail sales. The Boston and Philadelphia Districts said sales were flat to down but with sizable variation across stores, while sales mostly weakened in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Sales of apparel and luxury items were characterized as strong in several Districts. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all noted sluggish sales of big ticket household items such as furniture and appliances, and contacts in several Districts thought that heightened consumer anxiety was weighing on sales. Contacts in some Districts continued to indicate profit margins were being squeezed by rising input costs, although grocers in the Cleveland District were passing cost increases through to customers.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|9|Nonfinancial services activity edged higher in most Districts, although Minneapolis and Dallas characterized growth as flat or steady, and New York said conditions deteriorated. Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported generally solid demand for health-care services, although Richmond noted lower occupancies at senior care facilities due to difficulties among potential residents in selling their homes. Software and information technology firms in the Boston District reported mixed activity since July but expected to return to previous strong growth patterns by late 2011. The San Francisco District reported expanded sales for technology service providers due to heightened demand for software, e-books, and mobile applications. In contrast, an information technology contact in the Minneapolis District noted a decline in sales as a result of reduced demand from the government and financial services sectors.
summary|Manufacturing|2011|9|conditions were mixed across the country, but the pace of activity slowed in many Districts. The New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts reported declining activity overall, and contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted slowing demand from European customers. Cleveland said factory production was stable, and manufacturing activity in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts grew at a slower pace. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported slight expansions, and St. Louis said activity continued to increase and that several manufacturers planned to open plants and expand operations in the near future. Most manufacturing contacts were less optimistic than in the previous survey; however, future capital spending plans were solid in a few Districts.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|9|Residential real estate activity remained weak overall, although a few Districts noted some slight improvements. Contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported an increase in home sales over the previous year's weak levels; however, the uptick in the Atlanta District was concentrated mainly in Florida. The remaining Districts all reported stable or slower sales from the previous survey period, with several citing greater economic uncertainty as the primary cause. Both the New York and Philadelphia Districts reported that a growing backlog of foreclosures in New Jersey continued to weigh down the housing market. Home construction was down or stagnant in most Districts, with the exception of Minneapolis and Kansas City. However, several Districts indicated an improvement in home remodeling activity, and the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts reported increased demand for multi-family housing projects. Home prices were flat to slightly down in several Districts, although New York said prices in many areas edged higher but remained below year-ago levels. Contacts in the Boston District reported competitive pricing by sellers with even lower prices negotiated by buyers, but in the Cleveland District many builders have shifted away from discounting. Inventories were elevated or rising in the Boston, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, particularly for existing homes, and demand for apartment rental space increased in the San Francisco and Dallas Districts.
summary|Banking and Finance|2011|9|Most districts cited overall loan demand as stable to slightly weaker, with the exception of St. Louis, which reported a modest increase. Demand for business loans remained unchanged or weakened in the New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, but was moderately stronger in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts. Demand for consumer loans increased somewhat in the St. Louis District, but was unchanged to slightly weaker in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. While Kansas City reported a decline in commercial real estate loans, St. Louis cited a modest increase. New York and Cleveland noted increased demand for residential mortgages.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|9|Harsh summer weather strained agricultural activity in many Districts since the last survey period. Hot, dry weather stressed crops and livestock in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, with poor pasture conditions hastening herd liquidations in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Recent rains provided some relief to agricultural producers in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, but Hurricane Irene caused extensive damage to field crops not yet harvested in North Carolina. Shrinking production estimates pushed up crop prices and the Chicago District noted that robust ethanol production was also driving corn prices higher. Crop and livestock sales rose in the San Francisco District, and the Dallas District reported strong beef exports. Farmland values rose further in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts, but rising input costs trimmed farm capital spending in the Kansas City District.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|9|Labor markets were generally steady, although some Districts reported modest employment growth. Several Districts reported a shortage of skilled workers such as engineers, mechanics, and software developers. Jobs in the health care industry continued to increase, and the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts indicated growth in energy-related employment. Many Districts reported an increase in auto sales and service technician positions, and several companies in the Minneapolis District announced new manufacturing jobs. The Atlanta District noted that many contacts were focused on productivity and efficiency increases with existing staff, and Richmond said one firm would rather pay overtime than hire new workers. A large staffing firm in Chicago reported a decline in billable hours for staffing and professional services as well as fewer permanent placements, while Boston said demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring continued to grow. A major New York City employment agency reported unusually slow hiring activity in August but remained cautiously optimistic about future recruitment. Most Districts reported that wage pressures were minimal, but contacts noted some wage gains for several skilled positions as a result of heightened demand.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|9|District manufacturing activity contracted in August after stalling in July. A producer of modular homes stated that "business is terrible," citing this as the worst year in his 40 years in the business. Several textile manufacturers mentioned that markets for their products had grown considerably weaker since our last report, which they attributed in part to declining confidence among customers. Similarly, a producer of packaging film mentioned that his firm had cut production over the last three months. Moreover, a manufacturer of bottled and canned soft drinks noted sales were down sharply from last year, producing lower-than-normal sales for this time of year. Low-end cabinet makers reported that their firms continued to struggle with below-average profits. In contrast, high-end cabinet manufacturers affirmed that sales continued to improve, albeit at a slower rate than in the spring. The District manufacturing survey for August revealed that prices for both raw materials and finished goods grew at a somewhat quicker pace than a month ago.
richmond|Retail|2011|9|sales mostly weakened in late July through August. A wide range of retailers indicated that sales had declined in recent weeks as shoppers searched for bargains, while polled store managers at general merchandise stores mostly reported little change in revenues. A manager of a chain of hardware stores noted a decline in sales in recent months. Also, a contact told us that a Baltimore jeweler had little business over the last month other than engagement rings. A grocery executive reported higher revenues, while also indicating that his input prices had risen, putting pressure on margins. The pace of retail price increases stepped up from a month ago, according to our most recent survey.
richmond|Services|2011|9|Non-retail services firms saw an uptick in revenues in recent weeks, according to most contacts. Stronger consumer demand for services was reported in telecommunications and healthcare, and a food distributor in the Baltimore area noted increased demand from locally owned restaurants and delicatessens. A financial data services firm reported improving demand from restaurants and retailers in Maryland and Virginia, although other business services providers noted negative ripple effects from a slower economy. In contrast, an executive at a Virginia linen service stated that low bookings at hotels had reduced demand. Contacts at senior care facilities in Maryland and North Carolina remarked that expected new residents had postponed their move-in date while their homes remained on the market. Service sector prices grew at a slightly faster pace, according to our latest monthly survey.
richmond|Finance|2011|9|Lending activity was mixed since our last assessment. A banker in North Carolina stated that loan volume was "pretty good" in recent months, but added that most of the activity was market share gains rather than a piece of a growing market. Indeed, several bankers noted an increase in calls from businesses that were looking for new banking relationships, but few were ready to make a loan application. An official at a large bank in the District noted some improvement in loans for capital spending, but added that most was limited to replacing worn out capital. A commercial banker in Richmond cited recent cutbacks in loan demand from several manufacturers. A banker in rural Virginia described his loan demand as "extremely flat," with modest gains on the commercial side offset by weak demand on the consumer side. Several bankers noted weaker-than-expected mortgage demand over the last month. Most contacts stated that loan quality continued to improve, but several bankers indicated that they eased lending terms in order to compete for quality borrowers.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|9|Real estate activity weakened over the last four to six weeks. Several Realtors reported that sales had dropped considerably in recent months and that their markets were less active than a year ago. A Realtor in eastern Maryland indicated that home sales as well as average home prices were down notably from earlier in the year. A West Virginia Realtor said potential buyers were calling and looking for bargains, but that there were few actual sales. He mentioned that some sellers were starting to reduce prices significantly. Similarly, an agent in central Virginia noted that asking prices continued to fall. Most Realtors said that the high-end market was suffering, which they attributed to devalued portfolios of the wealthy, as well as uncertainty about employment and job stability. In contrast, a Realtor in the D.C. area reported that properties in the $900 thousand to $1.5 million price range moved quickly over the last month. He added that low interest rates and lean inventory, which reached its lowest level since February 2006, should help improve area sales in the fall.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|9|Reports on Fifth District labor market activity were mixed in August. Several employment agencies reported somewhat stronger demand for temporary help in recent weeks, particularly in the healthcare and automotive industries. The branch manager of a temp agency in North Carolina stated that manufacturers had openings for skilled positions, but they had difficulty finding machine operators with at least one year of experience. Likewise, a contact from South Carolina reported that three large manufacturers in the area were trying to hire, but could not find qualified candidates. In contrast, an executive from the D.C. area said that a major corporation had initiated a hiring and advertising freeze. Also, a banker indicated that some of his clients said that they would rather pay workers overtime than hire new workers, due in large part to the recent environment of heightened uncertainty. According to our latest survey, job losses in the service sector were somewhat more widespread than in our last report; wages in the retail sector weakened on average, while average wage growth slowed at services firms. Survey respondents from most manufacturing industries indicated that hiring inched up over the last month, while the average workweek declined and wage growth slowed.
richmond|Tourism|2011|9|generally strengthened over the last month, although contacts along the Atlantic coast lost significant end-of-summer business as Hurricane Irene came ashore one week before Labor Day weekend. Local evacuation orders in areas along the coast of North Carolina resulted in cancellations and shortened stays for the end of August. In addition, an hotelier in Virginia Beach reported several cancellations and early check-outs, as guests left the area ahead of the storm. Inland, however, hotel managers reported solid bookings, and several were experiencing a rush of hurricane evacuees. In the weeks prior to the hurricane, bookings had been strong, although some beach resorts used incentives to bolster reservations. According to a local contact, hotels in the D.C. area discounted room rates to boost reservations over the summer, which increased volume but held down margins.
richmond|Agriculture|2011|9|Scattered precipitation over the last two months promoted crop growth in many sections of the District, but more recently crops along the coast were damaged by Hurricane Irene. Rain in early August aided late summer peaches in West Virginia and soybean harvests in Virginia. Virginia growers were also busy cutting hay and preparing for the corn harvest and the flue-tobacco harvest was in full swing. Ninety-six percent of the corn crop in South Carolina had matured and was forty percent harvested up to the hurricane. However, post-hurricane inspections by state officials in North Carolina revealed widespread damage to field crops, poultry and other agricultural businesses. Moreover, agricultural agents in that state reported damage to greenhouses, grain storage facilities and aquaculture operations. Fortunately, cotton bolls had not been stripped from their plants by high winds, and tobacco farmers may have been saved by rushing their crops to curing barns before the storm stuck, according to the agricultural agents.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|9|Consumer spending rose modestly in late July and early August and was expected to remain solid in the months ahead. District retailers reported higher than expected sales and were somewhat optimistic about future business activity. Apparel and accessory items sold well during the back-to-school shopping season, but demand remained sluggish for large-ticket household items and appliances. Auto dealers reported strong sales, especially for new and used economy cars. Auto sales were expected to increase with the introduction of the new model year, and some dealerships were hiring salespeople and service technicians. Restaurants remained busy as total sales increased despite smaller average check amounts. After improving during the last survey period, travel and tourism activity generally held steady through the summer vacation season. District hotel owners reported increased occupancy at slightly lower average room rates.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|9|Manufacturing and high-tech service activity expanded slightly during the survey period, while transportation activity edged down. Manufacturing activity expanded at durable goods factories, particularly those producing machinery and electronic products, offsetting weakness at non-durable goods plants. The volume of new orders dipped in July, rebounded in August, and was expected to remain solid during the next six months. Shipment volumes held relatively steady, and order backlogs improved with a slight drop in finished goods inventories. With increased activity, durable goods manufacturers hired additional workers, while non-durable goods factories reduced worker hours. After softening earlier in the summer, capital spending was expected to strengthen in coming months. The high-tech industry reported a modest increase in sales, but contacts were concerned that economic uncertainty could dampen demand. Following steady growth during the last few months, activity in the transportation sector dipped below expectations, and firms remained concerned about high fuel costs and a shortage of qualified drivers.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|9|Residential and commercial real estate activity remained weak in late July and early August. Increased buyer traffic and declining home prices did not spur significantly more residential sales, and existing home inventories rose further. Several real estate contacts thought that economic uncertainty was limiting potential home buyer purchases despite low mortgage rates and reduced home prices. Residential mortgage lenders reported fewer loans for home purchases but an increase in loan refinancing activity. With more people staying in their current homes, construction supply firms noted solid sales for remodeling projects. After an early summer lull, some residential builders reported an uptick in building starts. With the exception of multi-family building projects, new commercial construction was very limited. Commercial real estate prices declined with weaker sales. Yet, lower commercial rents helped trim vacancy rates at commercial properties. District contacts expected commercial prices, rents and vacancy rates to hold steady in coming months. Developers reported little change in access to credit.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|9|In the recent survey period, bankers reported further improvements in loan quality and increased deposits amid somewhat weaker loan demand. Compared to a year ago, loan quality improved with lower delinquency rates, and bankers expected further improvements during the next six months. Overall loan demand decreased slightly as demand for commercial real estate loans declined, while demand for commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, and consumer installment loans held steady. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories. Deposits increased for the fifth straight survey with a few bankers noting that a flight-to-quality supported increased deposits. Bankers cited a weak and uncertain economic recovery and financial regulation as factors shaping expectations for the rest of the year.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|9|Extreme weather and rising input costs dampened farm income expectations since the last survey period. Drought continued to stress crops in Kansas and accelerated feedlot placements in Oklahoma due to poor pasture conditions. In contrast, most of the corn and soybean crops in Nebraska were in good or better condition with isolated reports of storm damage from high winds and hail. Farm capital spending waned as producers paid higher prices for production inputs such as fuel, fertilizer, and feed. Rising input costs strained profit margins, despite a modest rise in commodity prices. Loan repayment rates eased with weaker farm income. Farmland values rose further, but the pace of appreciation slowed.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|9|activity expanded further in late July and early August, and additional gains were expected in the coming months. The number of active drilling rigs in the District rose solidly as additional oil rigs in Oklahoma and New Mexico more than offset a slight decline in Wyoming. Wyoming producers noted that fewer drilling permits were being issued in the Powder River Basin, and the approval process for additional permits was taking longer. Several contacts reported that future drilling activity could be constrained due to a lack of qualified labor, equipment and supplies, and to a lesser degree, availability of financing. Some firms were offering higher wages to retain and recruit engineers and skilled field operators. Crude oil prices were expected to move higher due to strong global demand, but most producers felt natural gas prices would hold steady until the winter heating season began. District coal production increased in late July and early August, but remained below year-ago levels. Ethanol prices and profits retreated from recent highs as the industry increased production.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|9|Inflationary pressures softened during the last survey period as wage pressures remained low and fewer businesses expected to raise prices over the coming months. Most industries did not plan to raise wages, except for a few skilled positions, such as engineers, software developers, mechanics, and truck drivers. After rising modestly during the past survey period, fewer retailers expected to raise selling prices over the next three months. Restaurateurs, however, expected further increases in menu prices due to rising food costs. Fewer manufacturers reported price increases for raw materials, and most did not plan to pass on higher costs to finished goods prices. Builders and construction supply companies noted prices for construction materials generally held steady, with the exception of higher prices for petroleum-based products such as roofing shingles and asphalt. Transportation companies continued to pay high fuel prices, and some were considering raising rates.
san_francisco|Prices and Wages|2013|6|Price inflation was subdued for most final goods and services. Food industry contacts noted decreased prices of grain products but increased prices of some fruit and nut items. Contacts from retail grocery and restaurant chain establishments reported that overall food price inflation appears to have leveled off at a relatively modest pace.  Fees for legal services declined a bit. Several construction inputs, such as cement, logs, and lumber, edged up further. However, prices for other wood products, steel, and some metals declined.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2013|6|Retail sales were fairly soft overall. Sales of various digital and technology products slowed. Among computer and electronic products, sales of personal computers remained weak relative to sales of mobile computing devices, including smart phones and tablets. Demand for some gaming and entertainment products grew slightly, as did demand for apparel. Traditional retail grocers reported flat sales, with intensifying competition from discount and online retailers. Suppliers of food and beverage products noted increased sales. Automobile sales remained at high levels, although a shortage of used vehicles has restrained the pace of activity in some parts of the District.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2013|6|District manufacturing activity rose on net in the reporting period of early April through late May. New orders for electronic components were up a bit, and contacts indicated that they expect demand for semiconductors to pick up over the next couple of quarters. Pharmaceutical producers reported that innovative product launches contributed to continued modest gains for some firms, although overall activity seemed to be on a slight downward trajectory. Wood product manufacturers stated that demand grew further, fueled by rebounding domestic residential construction activity. However, contacts noted potential headwinds such as limited labor availability and transportation capacity. Demand for steel products used primarily in transportation infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects continued to increase, and capacity utilization ticked up.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2013|6|Agricultural sales and production increased modestly. Demand for most crop and livestock products grew further. Grain production was robust, but contacts reported some variability in vegetable production. Some contacts remained concerned that limited water availability in parts of the District could pass through to lower seasonal hiring and reduced agricultural output in coming months. Reports indicated that industry demand for electricity and natural gas grew robustly, although demand from households grew more sluggishly. While natural gas inventories rose slightly, the number of natural gas drilling rigs has fallen significantly since last year, due in part to the sustained low relative price of natural gas. Demand for gasoline was up in most regions.

While natural gas inventories rose slightly, the number of natural gas drilling rigs has fallen significantly since last year, due in part to the sustained low relative price of natural gas. Demand for gasoline was up in most regions.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2013|6|Residential real estate activity expanded robustly, and commercial real estate activity trended up at a more moderate pace overall. Home sales climbed in many regions, and tight inventories coupled with healthy demand supported continued house price appreciation. Reports indicated that the number of foreclosed properties available for sale has continued to decline significantly. Construction of multifamily residential projects increased in many areas, driven by low vacancy rates and strong demand for rental properties. Commercial real estate leasing and development activity expanded in most major metropolitan areas. However, several contacts in less-urban areas reported persistently high vacancy rates for office properties. In some regions, construction of publicly funded commercial projects has slowed due to funding constraints from state and local governments.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2013|6|Financial institutions reported that loan demand improved slightly on balance. Increased demand for mortgage and automobile loans drove growth in overall loan demand. However, some contacts recognized softness in business loan demand, due to continuing caution among borrowers. Banking contacts highlighted ample liquidity and generally stiff competition among lenders for well-qualified business borrowers. However, contacts reported that credit availability for small businesses remains limited. Although in past months contacts had pointed to a buildup of privately held technology companies poised for public offerings, the actual pace remains slow for initial public offerings, new venture capital deals, and private equity financing in the District's Internet and digital media subsectors.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2013|6|Retailers are rebounding from the negative impact of harsh and prolonged winter weather earlier this year, but the late arrival of warmer spring weather has affected the sales of some seasonal items. Merchant contacts report April year-over-year comp-store sales ranging from a 0.5 percent decline to a 9 percent increase. Demand is strong for women's apparel, home furnishings, and furniture. Respondents say consumer sentiment seems a bit more positive, especially over the last month or so, yet overall expectations remain cautious. Contacts continue to predict low-single digit sales increases for 2013.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2013|6|Three-quarters of contacted manufacturers report higher sales compared with the same period a year ago. Geographically, firms say that Europe remains weak and that both the U.S. and Asia are growing but slightly below expectations; by contrast, one contact called Europe a bright spot because it exceeded somewhat low expectations. An electrical equipment manufacturer reports low to middle single-digit growth across the board except for their products going into residential construction, which consistently rack up double-digit growth versus the year-earlier period. Several contacts, including the electrical equipment manufacturer and a supplier to the semiconductor industry report unusually volatile month-to-month readings.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2013|6|New England software and information technology services contacts generally report continued sluggishness through May to date, with year-over-year revenue increases moderating further in the most recent quarter to the low or middle single digits. Two contacts attribute the slowdown to economic uncertainties in the U.S. and Europe, which they say have led many manufacturers to delay the execution of long-term license agreements. A healthcare contact, by contrast, attributes the dip to the ending of federal stimulus funding for electronic health records software. Only one contact, a provider of cloud-based payment and banking software, reports accelerated growth, with revenues in the first quarter up more than 15 percent relative to Q1 2012. Lackluster activity has led the majority of contacts to slow the pace at which they are hiring; many now plan to maintain their current headcounts through the end of the year. Selling prices and capital and technology spending are largely unchanged. Looking forward, software and IT firms in New England remain cautiously optimistic, with most expecting more robust growth in the second half of 2013.
boston|Staffing Services|2013|6|First District staffing contacts report weaker-than-expected demand in recent weeks, with billable hours generally falling towards their year-earlier levels. The dip in activity reportedly reflects a leveling off in the IT sector and downticks in temporary and permanent hiring in the light industrial and manufacturing sectors. There is, however, renewed activity in the healthcare sector, with one contact reporting a substantial increase in demand for ambulatory nurses. In terms of labor supply, candidates with high-end skill sets, such as mechanical and electrical engineers and software developers, remain hard to find. Nevertheless, bill rates and pay rates have gone largely unchanged in 2013. Looking forward, staffing contacts are generally less upbeat than they were three months ago, with most expecting only modest growth through the end of 2013.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2013|6|Commercial real estate leasing and sales activity held roughly steady or improved in recent weeks in the First District. A Hartford contact notes a modest increase in foot traffic for downtown and suburban office space but no significant changes in rents or vacancy rates since the last report, virtually no construction, and a flat industrial market. In Boston's inner-suburban corridor, office rents are up and vacancies down. In Boston proper, prime retail rents are up at least 5 percent over the quarter; office fundamentals continue to improve across the city, very slowly in the financial district and at a brisker pace in the Seaport/Innovation district. Leasing volume dipped slightly in downtown Providence and mostly improved in suburban Rhode Island, with rents about flat. Defense-industry tenants in southern Rhode Island are reducing their space needs in response to federal spending cuts, moves that are likely to put downward pressure on rents in the local submarket in coming months. In Portland, retail leasing activity picked up and apartment rents rose while the office leasing market was flat. Business confidence in southern Maine reportedly improved but no major expansions or hiring plans were announced.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2013|6|Throughout much of the First District, the median sales price of single-family homes and condos rose year-over-year in March and April. Sales of single-family homes also increased from a year earlier in most of the region during April, after weaker sales results in March. According to contacts, demand for homes remains strong due to low interest rates, relatively low prices, and improving confidence among buyers. However, contacts continue to report that shrinking inventory levels are slowing sales and placing upward pressure on prices. In Massachusetts and the Greater Boston area, dwindling inventory levels have been a significant source of concern; contacts in the other states also express worry about falling inventory levels, but to a lesser extent. Several respondents note that much of the housing recovery has been centered around urban areas while rural areas have experienced more modest improvements. Within the Greater Boston area, realtors have observed an increasing frequency of multiple offers on properties.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|6|Consumer spending grew slightly due in part to a late spring. A Minneapolis area mall reported that recent traffic was level with a year ago, but sales for most tenants were up. A mall manager in Montana noted that apparel sales were slow, but jewelry sales were much higher than a year ago. A Minnesota-based retailer reported that the extended winter weather slowed spring sales of apparel and other items. A Minnesota auto dealer reported level sales over the past couple of months. A representative of an auto dealers association in Montana noted moderate growth in recent auto sales compared with a year earlier at dealerships in the state.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2013|6|Despite the inclement weather, commercial construction activity continued to increase since the last report. The value of April commercial permits in Billings increased 11 percent from last year, while hotel building rose to $11 million in April compared with zero in the first four months of 2012. In Sioux Falls, S.D., April permits were up 2 percent from a year ago. A Minnesota manufacturer plans to build an office building. However, in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, April nonresidential construction activity decreased from a year ago, according to a market research firm. Residential construction increased rapidly over past year. The value of April residential permits in Sioux Falls more than quadrupled from a year earlier. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, April residential permitted units more than doubled compared with April 2012. The value of April residential building permits in Billings was up 77 percent from last year, mostly due to multifamily building.
minneapolis|Services|2013|6|Activity at professional business services firms increased at a moderate pace since the last report. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's annual survey of professional services companies (conducted in May) showed that over the past four quarters, sales revenue, space usage, productivity and profits grew, and these are expected to increase over the next year. Contacts from the trucking industry expect minimal growth in freight volumes during the second half of the year.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2013|6|activity continued to expand moderately. An April survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas at a slightly faster pace than in recent months. A Minnesota tractor manufacturer announced a $43 million expansion plan, while a vehicle producer is investing $20 million to expand research and development at a North Dakota facility. Plans were announced for a $1 billion fertilizer plant in North Dakota.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2013|6|The energy sector remained strong, while mining activity slowed. Late-May oil and gas exploration activity increased in North Dakota and was flat in Montana compared with the last report. In North Dakota, a $400 million oil refinery will break ground this spring and a 120-car rail terminal is in the works to handle crude oil. Exports of coal from Montana's Powder River basin hit record levels even as domestic demand dwindled. Meanwhile, production at Minnesota iron ore mines through April was about 5 percent lower than for the same period in 2012.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2013|6|While a late spring delayed planting, recent rains brought drought relief for District agricultural producers. According to the Minneapolis Fed's first-quarter (April) survey of agricultural credit conditions, nearly 90 percent of respondents said farm incomes increased or held steady over the previous three months, with similar results for farm household and farm capital spending. Expectations for the second quarter were more moderate. District corn, soybean and spring wheat planting progress was behind average for late May, but producers were catching up quickly after a delayed spring. Prices increased from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, hay, eggs, chicken and dairy products; prices fell for hogs, turkey and dry beans, while cattle prices were flat. USDA forecasts call for substantially lower prices for corn and soybeans for the coming year, with slight reductions in wheat prices.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|6|Labor markets tightened since the last report, particularly in the western part of the District. Labor markets remained very tight in and near the oil boom area in western North Dakota and eastern Montana, although some easing in the pace of growth was noted over the past six months. Contacts in manufacturing and agribusiness in eastern South Dakota expect to increase employment slightly over the next six months. Results from the aforementioned professional services survey show that respondents saw employment growth over the past 12 months and expect more growth in the next year.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2013|6|Reports from District factories indicated that new orders and production were largely stable or increased during the past six weeks. Domestic sales were stronger than those to offshore customers, with declines in Europe being more acute than in China. Companies seeing the strongest activity were suppliers to the oil and gas, residential construction, and transportation industries. Defense contractors and suppliers to the coal industry experienced weakening activity. Compared to a year ago, production levels were mixed. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volumes were stable but remain below levels seen early in the first quarter. Several contacts expressed concern about the quantity of steel produced in China and Europe that is now being imported into the United States. Motor vehicle production at District plants rose at a robust pace during April on a month-over-month and year-over-year basis. Looking forward, many of our contacts believe that business conditions will continue to slowly improve during the second half of the year.

Looking forward, many of our contacts believe that business conditions will continue to slowly improve during the second half of the year.
cleveland|Real Estate|2013|6|Sales of new and existing single-family homes trended higher and they were above year-ago levels. Our contacts attributed this trend to low interest rates, favorable prices, and an improving labor market. One builder commented that young people are less inclined to buy a house than were their parents due to a perceived lack of value and a desire for mobility. He believes that this reluctance may put downward pressure on the housing industry for years to come. New home contracts were found mostly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories. Demand for multifamily housing remains strong. Builders expressed confidence that the turnaround in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months. However, they cited difficulty in obtaining financing and low inventory as barriers to more robust growth in their industry. List prices of new homes increased by as much as 10 percent in certain markets this year due primarily to rising construction costs. Builders have cut back on discounting.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2013|6|Most retailers reported that April sales fell short of expectations. Some of our contacts cited colder-than-normal weather for holding down consumer spending. Others saw a pickup in purchases of large home goods such as furniture and exercise equipment. On a year-over-year basis, volume was up slightly. Going into summer, sales are projected to be modestly higher, when compared to the same time period last year. Vendor and shelf prices held steady. A food retailer commented that his customers remain sensitive to changes in gasoline prices, with any hike in gas prices negatively impacting his sales. Capital expenditures were on plan for the fiscal year. Monies are allocated primarily for improvements to distribution systems and new store construction. No hiring is anticipated, except for staffing new stores.
cleveland|Banking|2013|6|Demand for business credit has increased, but at a slower rate, since our last report. Although loan requests originated from many sectors, commercial real estate and industrial production stood out. A few bankers commented that insufficient collateral was the primary reason behind small business owners being denied credit. Consumer credit demand rose slightly, especially for auto loans. Installment loans are growing in popularity, whereas drawdowns on home equity lines of credit trended lower. Residential mortgage activity was stable. The shift in applications from refinancing to new purchase grew. Delinquency rates declined across consumer and commercial loan categories. No substantive changes were made to loan-application standards. Aggregate core deposits grew at a steady pace, with a movement from CDs to demand deposits still taking place. Customer preferences for online banking, rising use of ATMs, and shrinking net interest margins were factors cited by some of our contacts for cutting payrolls and reducing the number of branches.
cleveland|Energy|2013|6|Coal production continued to trend down across the District, although lower production numbers are showing signs of stabilizing. One producer noted that demand from domestic utility companies is up slightly, while offshore demand is slowing or stagnant. Spot prices for steam-coal rose slightly, whereas metallurgical coal prices were flat. The number of drilling rigs across the District was little changed over the past six weeks but has fallen since the beginning of the year. Ohio and West Virginia issued shale gas drilling permits at a robust pace. Output from conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas wells was flat during the past couple of months. In the wet gas regions of Ohio and West Virginia, output should begin to increase later in the year as newly constructed gas processing units come on line. Well-head prices for natural gas are trending higher, but not to the point that would encourage aggressive drilling. Capital expenditures were at targeted levels, with little change expected. No change in production equipment and material prices was reported.  payrolls held steady. Labor costs were stable except for increases in health insurance premiums.
cleveland|Freight Transportation|2013|6|Our contacts described shipping volume as robust and higher than expected. Demand was particularly strong from motor vehicle and energy-related customers. Freight executives are optimistic about growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Diesel-fuel prices trended lower, and costs associated with equipment and maintenance items were stable. The biggest concern facing trucking companies at this time is the potential impact on operations (number of trucks and drivers, productivity, and pricing) due to the new hours of service (HOS) rules that go into effect on July 1. Capital spending is on plan for the fiscal year. Two of our contacts reported that they will be investing heavily in equipment that will service their energy customers. Another commented that his firm will order more trucks than originally budgeted to add capacity. Hiring is for replacement and capacity expansion. The industry is still experiencing a shortage of drivers and skilled mechanics. The former may worsen under the new HOS regulations.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|6|District retail contacts noted an improvement in consumer spending but were cautiously optimistic regarding their outlook. Reports indicated that consumers remained focused on deals and discounts but high-end luxury stores continued to perform well. Relatively stable gasoline prices along with improvements in the housing market were cited as contributing positively to consumer behavior. Automobile sales remained steady at high levels.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2013|6|Similar to our last report, District brokers reported that existing home sales remained ahead of last year's level. Sales growth still remained the strongest among Florida contacts. Brokers continued to report that low home inventories were restraining sales. Homes were also noted as appraising below market price which was either slowing sales or in some cases halting sales altogether. Existing home prices continued to rise on a year-over-year basis and brokers indicated that price growth was a bit stronger than in our last report. The outlook for sales growth remained positive, with the majority of brokers anticipating sales gains over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2013|6|District manufacturers continued to report expanding activity in April and May. Growth was driven by increases in new orders, production, and employment. Much of this expansion was attributed to the region's large auto and energy manufacturing presence. Nearly half of the region's purchasing managers expect production to be higher in the near term.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2013|6|Overall demand for new loans remained weak as banks faced significant pressure to improve net interest margins and increased competition from non-bank providers of capital, such as private equity groups. Bankers noted that businesses were taking on debt where necessary to maintain and refurbish equipment to meet current demand rather than making capital investment aimed at future growth.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2013|6|District payrolls grew at a mild pace since our last report. The bulk of jobs added were concentrated in Florida and Georgia. Hiring in professional and business services was especially strong in these states; in addition, employment in retail and real estate was notably strong in Florida. Hiring in leisure and hospitality services, particularly accommodation and food services, increased in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Government employment decreased in every District state except for Georgia, where gains were meager.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2013|6|Low natural gas prices continued to provide cost savings for industrial contacts in the region. Refiners along the Gulf of Mexico completed the seasonal process of switching from winter to summer gasoline blends and were ramping up production to meet higher demand from the summer driving season. Although the total number of rigs operating in the Gulf was roughly constant over the reporting period, drilling activity continued to shift from gas to oil,in part as a response to the ongoing price disparity between the two natural resources. In line with historical seasonal patterns, inventories of crude oil in the region rose considerably, supported by rising national oil production and soft demand.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2013|6|Retailers report that sales were generally soft in April but strong in early May. One major retail chain reports that same-store sales were somewhat below plan in April--partly due to cool weather--but picked up in early May; another indicates that sales have been running somewhat ahead of plan in both months. Both retailers indicate that their New York City stores performed relatively strongly. Two malls in upstate New York report that business was sluggish in April, partly due to cool weather, but has been brisk in the first half of May; a number of new stores are scheduled to open in the weeks ahead. Inventories remain at desired levels, prices are characterized as steady, and no unusual discounting is reported.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2013|6|Residential real estate markets in the District have strengthened further since the last report. New York City's home sales and rental markets have shown further signs of tightening--on both the sales and rental sides. Both apartment sales prices and transaction volume continue to run well ahead of a year ago in Manhattan and especially in prime areas of Brooklyn, reflecting a low inventory of available units. The rental market also remains tight: rents continue to rise at a roughly 6-7 percent annual rate in Manhattan and at a somewhat faster pace in Brooklyn; the Queens rental market is also seeing a pickup. Long Island, where the housing market had been generally flat until recently, has seen a recent sharp pickup in pending home sales and a drop in the inventory of homes for sale. Northern New Jersey continues to see modest, steady improvement in its housing market. With a relatively low inventory of new homes, prices are rising gradually; however, a sizable overhang of distressed properties is reported to be restraining price appreciation. A real estate contact in western New York reports increasingly strong market conditions: inventories have fallen, bidding wars have become increasingly common, and home prices have been rising.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2013|6|Manufacturing contacts again report steady business activity in recent weeks, while their optimism about the near-term outlook has waned somewhat. In contrast, contacts in other sectors generally report some pickup in business activity and employment; they also express increased optimism about the business outlook, and a growing number of them plan to add workers and increase capital spending. Price pressures are mostly reported to be steady and moderate in the manufacturing sector but more widespread among service-sector businesses; still, relatively few service-sector contacts say they are increasing their selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2013|6|Small- to medium-sized banks report an increase in demand for all types of loans except for commercial & industrial loans, where demand was unchanged. Bankers report little change in demand for refinancing, on balance. Contacts report that credit standards are unchanged across all loan categories. Bankers continue to indicate narrowing in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--most notably in commercial mortgages. Interest rates on deposits continue to decline, on balance. Finally, bankers report fairly widespread decreases in delinquency rates for all loan categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2013|6|Growth in consumer spending increased slightly in April and May. The delayed arrival of warmer weather spurred sales of spring and summer items such as clothing, building materials, and lawn and garden items. In contrast, furniture and restaurant sales slowed. Promotional activity was heavy during the reporting period. Even absent from sales, contacts noted a more general tendency for customers to move to lower-priced items within shopping categories, especially in food and clothing. Several retail contacts also pointed to the expiration of the payroll tax credit and less spending out of tax refund checks as having a negative effect on their sales. Auto sales were moderately higher. New vehicle sales fell short relative to expectations, but used vehicle sales increased at a faster pace. Small, fuel efficient, crossover vehicles were the strongest sellers, while pick-up truck sales were a little soft.
chicago|Business Spending|2013|6|Growth in business spending slowed in April and May. Inventory investment decreased. Retail contacts reported that inventories were at comfortable levels, and, because of low sales expectations, they did not anticipate any substantial stockbuilding over the remainder of the year. Manufacturers also noted closely monitoring inventories given recently weaker demand. Capital expenditures were limited. A number of contacts reported that elevated uncertainty was curtailing their capital spending, pointing to doubts about the durability of the recovery as well as concerns over national fiscal policy. Labor market conditions continued to improve slowly. Uncertainty over health care costs and the pending implementation of the Affordable Care Act caused some firms to delay hiring plans or increase usage of temporary workers. Demand for skilled workers, however, remained strong, with a recruiting firm noting an increase in client orders for healthcare, information technology, and engineering occupations. Contacts indicated that even in the mining industry, where activity has weakened substantially, firms continue to hire engineers at a rapid pace.
chicago|Construction/real estate|2013|6|Growth in construction and real estate activity picked up in April and May. Demand for residential construction grew steadily, as multifamily construction remained strong and conditions for single-family construction continued to improve. Activity in the residential real estate market increased, with home sales, prices, and residential rents rising. Contacts noted that the still large number of underwater mortgages, extended foreclosure processes, and low level of new construction meant that the inventory of existing homes on the market was tight and that this was restraining sales. Nonresidential construction increased at a modest pace. Contacts noted, however, increased activity in the manufacturing sector, particularly from the auto industry. Commercial real estate conditions continued to improve, although vacancy rates remained elevated. Contacts also reported an increase in demand for leasing was pushing up commercial rents, with demand from the healthcare sector noted as being particularly strong.
chicago|Manufacturing|2013|6|The decline in manufacturing production growth flattened out in April and May. Although the auto industry remained a source of strength, it too grew at a more moderate pace. An increase in imports of steel displaced domestic production; nonetheless, a steel industry contact reported that capacity utilization gradually increased over the reporting period. Specialty metal manufacturers reported small increases in new orders, noting that their customers had become more cautious, ordering only as necessary with very short lead times and reassessing supply chains in an effort to cut costs. Exports of heavy machinery were lower, due to weaker demand in Europe and Asia. Contacts in the heavy equipment industry reported that equipment dealers continue to reduce their inventories and that most mining companies have trimmed their orders due to cutbacks in mining investment. In contrast, demand for heavy trucks increased. Suppliers to the aerospace industry noted a pick-up in orders following resolution of the issues affecting the Boeing 787. Improvement in the housing sector also continued to benefit manufacturers of household products such as appliances and fixtures.
chicago|Banking/finance|2013|6|Credit conditions eased some over the reporting period. Corporate borrowing costs declined and demand increased in corporate debt markets as investors continue to reach for higher yields. Banking contacts reported modest growth in business loan demand, with greater competition for high quality assets among larger banks leading to some downward pressure on pricing. Mortgage refinance activity, while still strong, began to slow, but contacts noted a slight increase in purchase applications. Several contacts also reported that the new rules regarding eligibility for GSE backed mortgages are likely to limit the number of people who qualify. With demand deposits growing and comfortable liquidity levels, banks are increasing their willingness to lend. Smaller banks, however, continue to lag behind larger ones, with many noting greater regulatory uncertainty in their traditional areas of lending as a key reason why. Contacts also noted that risk profiles remain slow to change, indicating that a lack of secondary loan market demand and low appraisals of commercial real estate values continue to constrain lending.
chicago|Prices/costs|2013|6|Cost pressures were steady in April and May. Commodity prices were generally somewhat lower, although some contacts noted increases in the prices paid for natural gas, lumber, drywall, copper, steel, and aluminum. Retailers again reported mostly modest increases in wholesale prices, with the exception of continued cost pressures for some food items originating from last year's drought. Overall, pass-through to downstream prices remained limited. Wage pressures were again moderate, although many contacts noted rising healthcare costs and uncertainty about future employee healthcare obligations associated with the Affordable Care Act.
chicago|Agriculture|2013|6|Heavy precipitation in the District aided the recovery from last year's drought by replenishing subsoil moisture. The rain also dramatically slowed planting of corn; farmers almost caught up, often by working around the clock once fields had dried sufficiently. However, the emergence of corn plants significantly lagged that of a typical year. Soybean planting progressed at about its normal pace once the corn crop was in the ground. Flooding from the heavy rains also resulted in river closures, delaying deliveries of agricultural products and farm inputs, particularly fertilizer. Current corn and soybean prices rose, as stocks remained low. Late planting pushed back the availability of new supplies into September. However, price declines were anticipated for the new crop in the fall, as concerns over major yield losses abated. Milk and hog prices moved higher; cattle prices were flat.
dallas|Prices|2013|6|Most responding firms said prices were steady and they expect increases to remain modest for the remainder of the year. One exception is home prices, which have risen strongly due to pent-up demand and low inventories. While some contacts said prices for construction materials were up, others said increased competition had lowered prices. There were some reports that builders expect less price pass-through going forward. Transportation service industry contacts noted increased shipping rates earlier in the year, but expect price gains to ease with recent declines in the price of jet fuel. Automobile dealers said prices held steady. Cattle prices trended lower over the past six weeks while retail beef prices rose to a record-high due to strong demand.
dallas|Labor Market|2013|6|Employment held steady at most responding firms. There were scattered reports of hiring from some transportation manufacturing and transportation services firms. Financial firms added employees to comply with regulatory stress testing and wealth management, and noted employment growth in Austin and the Eagle Ford Shale area. Several contacts reported difficulty finding qualified people to fill vacancies, particularly in staffing services, accounting, machinery manufacturing, IT and IT-related retail. A construction-related manufacturer noted truck drivers were in short supply. Wage pressures remained largely subdued, although increased compensation was reported in legal and financial services.
dallas|Manufacturing|2013|6|Reports on construction-related manufacturing were mixed, although firm outlooks remain mostly optimistic. Some lumber producers noted increased activity, while others said sales were less than expected. A cement producer noted strong growth in residential demand--especially in Houston--and a recent boost from commercial infrastructure construction in Dallas. Fabricated metals producers said demand remained steady for both private and public projects. Primary metals producers said demand had slowed slightly since the last reporting period, and outlooks were cautious.
dallas|Retail Sales|2013|6|Retail sales volumes increased over the reporting period and are up from a year ago. According to one national retailer, Texas continued to outperform the nation. Outlooks for the upcoming quarter and the rest of the year are positive.
dallas|Nonfinancial Services|2013|6|Staffing services contacts said demand was flat over the past six weeks. Placements were strong in mortgage-related finance and residential construction jobs. One firm noted an increase in the number of jobs but a decline in workweeks as businesses redistribute hours to minimize the impact of health care reform. Since the last Beige Book, accounting demand was strong and firms noted a moderate increase in non-tax-related work over the reporting period, with advisory work leading the way. Legal firms reported modest demand growth, particularly for intellectual property litigation, real estate, wealth planning and health care work. Outlooks were mildly optimistic, with strength expected in real estate and corporate work.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2013|6|The Texas housing sector continued to improve over the past six weeks. Contacts said home sales remained strong with inventories still low, despite some reports that more homes were being listed. New home construction activity picked up pace since the last report, although some contacts mentioned higher prices may slow sales growth later in the year. Apartment construction remained at high levels and investment activity for multifamily projects continued to be strong, according to respondents.
dallas|Financial Services|2013|6|Financial institutions experienced modest growth in loan demand, with robust growth in residential mortgages and auto lending and weakness continuing in corporate transactions. Non-performing loans continue to improve and debtors are rapidly paying down mortgages and auto loans. Loan pricing remains very competitive. Deposits increased modestly and deposit rates remained mostly unchanged. Employment and compensation growth were flat for the most part. Mortgage lending is expected to remain robust.
dallas|Energy|2013|6|activity improved since the last report. The Texas rig count increased, and contacts noted strong global demand. Respondents expect further improvement in the second half of the year, especially due to anticipated increases in rig activity and production from the Gulf of Mexico.
dallas|Agriculture|2013|6|Drought conditions continued to worsen slightly across most of the District over the reporting period, despite scattered rainfall. The Texas wheat crop suffered from dry weather and late freezes and production is expected to be significantly below average. Conditions for other crops are generally worse than at this same time last year but not quite as bad as in 2011.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2013|6|Contacts reported that retail sales in the past three months were up, on average, relative to the same period last year. Forty percent of contacts noted moderate increases in sales, while 40 percent noted minor decreases and the rest saw no changes. Forty percent of retailers reported that sales levels met their expectations, and the rest reported that sales fell short of expectations. About sixty percent of retailers noted that their inventories were at desired levels, while the rest reported that their inventory levels were too high. The sales outlook over the next three months was slightly positive: 40 percent of retailers expect sales to increase over 2012 levels, and the remaining contacts expect sales to stay the same. The general outlook for the retail industry over the next three months was largely positive. Contacts noted increases in new store openings, but some expressed concern about the effects of the online sales tax bill on their sales.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|6|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our last report. Several manufacturing firms reported plans to add workers, expand operations, or open new facilities in the District, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to reduce employment. Firms in automobile, automobile parts, appliance, asphalt products, plastics packaging, chemical, steel, and furniture manufacturing plan to hire new workers and expand operations. In contrast, firms in medical devices, commercial printing, and beverage manufacturing reported plans to lay off workers. A recent survey of manufacturers showed increased new orders and capacity utilization for the majority of firms.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2013|6|Home sales have continued to increase throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2012, April 2013 year-to-date home sales were up 16 percent in Louisville, 32 percent in Little Rock, 7 percent in Memphis, and 13 percent in St. Louis. April 2013 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2012. Permits increased 20 percent in Louisville, 4 percent in Little Rock, 27 percent in Memphis and 20 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2013|6|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks found little change in overall lending activity during the first quarter of 2013. During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans ranged from unchanged to eased somewhat, and the demand for such loans ranged from moderately stronger to moderately weaker. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans ranged from basically unchanged to eased somewhat, while demand ranged from mostly unchanged to moderately stronger. Credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans remained unchanged and demand ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards and demand for consumer loans remained mostly unchanged. Demand for auto loans ranged from moderately stronger to moderately weaker, while demand for other consumer loans was unchanged.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|6|Because of persistent rains, District farmers are behind their average planting schedules. Planting progress for cotton, rice, and soybeans in Mississippi was approximately half the 5-year average. Across all other District states, soybean planting progress was approximately 15 percent slower than its 5-year average. As of mid-May, well over 90 percent of the District's winter wheat crop was rated in fair or better condition and close to 70 percent was rated as good or excellent. Year-to-date coal production across the District states (excluding eastern Kentucky) for April was 3.3 percent lower compared with the same period in 2012, while coal output for April 2013 was similar to April 2012.
st_louis|Prices, Wages, and Employment|2013|6|Fifty-five percent of contacts indicated that prices charged to consumers over the past three months have stayed the same, while 34 percent indicated that prices have increased relative to the same period last year. In turn, 30 percent of contacts noted that wages over the past three months have stayed the same, while 66 percent noted that wages have increased. Meanwhile, 45 percent of contacts reported that employment levels have remained the same over the past three months, while 37 percent reported that employment levels have increased, compared with the same period last year.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2013|6|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported that orders and shipments have fallen somewhat. The makers of food products, lumber and wood products, paper products, and fabricated metals have reported gains since the last Beige Book. The makers of primary metals, electronic equipment, and instruments reported lower activity. Reports were mixed for makers of industrial machinery. Firms supplying the home-building sector reported strong orders and ongoing hiring to keep pace. Other contacts attributed growing demand to the oil and gas, auto-related, and aerospace sectors. Firms supplying other sectors reported flat or weakened demand. Employment levels were generally reported as flat to down.
philadelphia|Retail|2013|6|Third District retailers reported moderate growth overall. Since Easter sales shifted to March this year, April began with a continuation of modest growth; however, retailers reported strong sales for Mother's Day weekend. Restaurants were booked with moms and their families, which generated heavy traffic and sales for adjacent retailers. Volatile spring temperatures created challenges for apparel retailers as shoppers shifted their interest between winter and summer lines with the rise and fall of the thermometer. Promotional sales remained critical for producing the best results for many retailers.
philadelphia|Finance|2013|6|Overall, Third District financial firms have reported slight increases in total loan volume since the previous Beige Book. Banking contacts cited stronger demand for C&I loans and real estate loans--commercial and residential. Credit card loan volumes were relatively unchanged, while reports of other consumer lending were mixed. A nascent housing recovery in many Third District markets has increased demand for new mortgages and the ratio of purchases to refinancings. A small amount of hiring has been prompted at banks and bank servicing companies by the moderate recovery, as well as by changing compliance regulations. Banking contacts reported little change in lending standards overall; however, a few banks reported some easing for commercial real estate loans. Most banks continued to report improving credit quality. Many banks cited strong competition within their local markets. Financial institutions remain generally optimistic about future growth.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2013|6|Following a little softness, homebuilders throughout most of the Third District resumed a moderate growth of contracts signed for new construction. Contracts signed from January through May--"Five good months in a row!" one builder exclaimed--have generated significantly greater construction activity than last year for many builders, large and small. Significant cost pressures face builders as the long housing recession has disrupted the supply chain for materials and the pool of skilled workers. In addition, some builders have faced labor shortages due to higher wages offered for certain trades that are in demand for the Hurricane Sandy recovery. Residential brokers reported moderate activity during April and May for the Third District overall. Existing home sales that closed during the period varied geographically with strong growth reported in the Philadelphia market. Brokers were also pleased by even stronger growth of sales contracts pending, which was more widely reported throughout the District. The estimated months' supply of the existing inventory of homes continued to fall significantly. Brokers still expect that a shadow inventory of homes held by reluctant, if not underwater, owners will emerge as prices begin to rise once more.
philadelphia|Services|2013|6|Third District service-sector firms are reporting a moderate pace of growth overall--a bit stronger than the last Beige Book. On the heels of a strong winter/spring season, resorts in the Poconos are entering their summer season with strong bookings and many sold-out weekends. Stronger cash flows are allowing properties to reinvest by refurbishing and adding new amenities. At least one major new resort is making plans to enter the market. Early bookings are also up along the shore in Delaware and New Jersey. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the state of New Jersey has launched a sizeable marketing campaign to remind people that most of the shoreline tourist area remains intact and ready for vacationers.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2013|6|Overall, price levels continued to increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Manufacturing firms continued to report slight overall increases for prices paid and slight overall decreases in prices received. Auto dealers reported no changes in pricing. Despite passing along some costs, homebuilders continued to face tight margins with lumber and skilled labor commanding high prices. Most real estate contacts reported stable, if not rising, prices for lower priced homes, and contacts in some markets noted stable prices for higher priced homes. Wage pressures remain constrained, according to most contacts other than homebuilders. Rising costs associated with medical insurance benefits remain a concern for many employers.
summary|Manufacturing|2013|6|The manufacturing sector expanded in most Districts since the previous Beige Book. Activity increased in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  contacts in the New York District reported steady business activity. In the Philadelphia District, manufacturers reported that orders and shipments have fallen somewhat, and in the Richmond District, manufacturing activity softened since the previous report, although there were scattered reports of improvement. Most firms in the Boston District are reasonably optimistic about the outlook, and many contacts in the Cleveland District believe that business conditions will continue to improve slowly during the second half of the year. However, the near-term outlook has waned somewhat in the New York District.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|6|Most Districts noted that consumer spending increased during the reporting period, ranging from slight to moderate gains. Retail activity in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts was characterized as modest or moderate, while the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported slight growth. Retailers in the New York District reported that sales were tepid in April but picked up in May. Meanwhile, the Richmond District noted that sales were flat during the reporting period. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported that late winter weather slowed retail sales; the Chicago District noted that sales picked up once warmer weather arrived. Demand for home furnishings and furniture was strong or picked up in the Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts; however, furniture sales slowed in the Chicago District. The Kansas City District reported that appliance purchases were particularly strong. Inventories were generally at desired levels in the New York and Chicago Districts. The outlook for retail spending was positive in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while more cautious expectations were noted in the Boston, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2013|6|Nonfinancial services activity grew at a modest to moderate pace since the previous report. The Philadelphia District noted steady gains, while moderate growth was reported in the Minneapolis District. The San Francisco District saw flat demand for health care and legal services. The Boston District noted sluggish activity in information technology services, while the Kansas City District saw increased demand for high tech services. Information technology, distribution, business support, health care, engineering, and hospitality firms expanded in the St. Louis District. The Richmond District reported "renewed vigor," especially for technology and architectural firms. The Dallas District saw strong demand for accounting services and modest increases in legal services.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2013|6|Residential real estate and construction activity increased at a moderate to strong pace in all Districts. Several Districts reported that higher demand and low inventory of homes available for sale are resulting in multiple offers on properties. Almost all Districts reported higher home sale prices. The Kansas City District reported concerns that appraisals were not keeping pace with price increases. Foreclosed properties available for sale have declined significantly in the San Francisco District. The rental market remains tight with noticeable increases in rental rates in the New York District. Residential construction increased across all of the reporting Districts. Several Districts noted increases in multifamily projects. The Minneapolis District reported that many markets saw huge percentage increases in building permits from a year ago. Builders are cutting back on discounting in the Cleveland District. The Richmond District noted that increased construction has pushed up the price of building lots, and the Atlanta District reported that the lack of available lots has constrained building activity. The Philadelphia District commented that builders are facing problems, as the long housing recession has disrupted the supply chain for materials and the pool of skilled workers.
summary|Banking and Finance|2013|6|Overall bank lending increased modestly since the previous report. The Cleveland District noted that consumer demand for auto loans increased and that demand for residential loans shifted from refinancing to new purchases. The Chicago District indicated modest growth in business loan demand. The Dallas District reported robust growth in residential mortgages and auto lending with continued weakness in corporate transactions. The New York District saw an increase in demand for all types of loans except commercial and industrial loans, where demand was unchanged. San Francisco District banking contacts reported ample liquidity and competition among lenders for well-qualified business borrowers but limited credit availability for small businesses. The Philadelphia District noted slow loan growth, and the Atlanta District reported weak loan activity.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|6|Agricultural conditions remained mixed across Districts, as weather patterns varied. Recent rains brought drought relief to the Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts but delayed or slowed plantings in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Meanwhile, drought conditions worsened in the Dallas District, and contacts in the San Francisco District remained concerned that limited water availability in parts of the District could pass through to lower seasonal hiring and reduced agricultural output in coming months. Farm incomes increased in the Minneapolis District, while farm income growth softened in the Kansas City District. Well over 90 percent of the St. Louis District's winter wheat crop was rated in fair or better condition, but winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further in the Kansas City District, with much of the crop in relatively poor condition. Forage crops were having a great spring in the Richmond District, and pastures and hayfields were in good condition.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|6|Hiring increased at a measured pace in several Districts, with some contacts noting difficulty finding qualified workers. Labor markets continued to improve in the New York District. The Boston District reported that with only a few exceptions, businesses were not hiring much beyond replacement, while labor markets in the Richmond District were uneven. Labor markets continued to improve slowly in the Chicago District. The St. Louis District reported that employment levels over the past three months have stayed the same or increased for a majority of contacts. Labor markets tightened in the Minneapolis District, particularly near the oil boom area in western North Dakota and eastern Montana, although some easing in the pace of growth was noted over the past six months. Labor markets were steady in the Dallas District. The New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts cited examples of contacts reporting difficulty finding qualified people to fill vacancies. The Richmond and Cleveland Districts noted that new hours of service regulations may exacerbate difficulty finding truck drivers. A number of Districts reported solid demand for workers in information technology, health care, and engineering. The Richmond and Atlanta Districts cited employment reductions due to cutbacks in government orders or staffing at government offices. Among staffing services firms, billable hours increased in the Philadelphia District but decreased in the Boston District. Meanwhile, staffing services were steady in the Dallas District and mixed in the Cleveland District. The outlook for hiring was generally positive in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts.
richmond|Manufacturing|2013|6|Fifth District manufacturing activity softened since our last report, although there were scattered reports of improvement. A machinery producer said that his company was struggling to hit the break even mark again this month and that the volume of new orders was down considerably. Impacts of sequestration and tax changes were noted by several firms. A manufacturer of automobile convertible tops reported that the uncertainty of tax issues had slowed investment at his firm. Moreover, a producer of defense equipment cited government sequestration and orders being canceled or delayed as major concerns facing his company. In contrast, a lumber producer mentioned that, because of the improvement in the housing market, his company had earned a profit in the first four months of this year, and a flooring manufacturer also reported improving business. Price growth in raw materials slowed in recent weeks and finished goods prices grew at a somewhat quicker pace.
richmond|Ports|2013|6|Shipments increased at District ports, especially for container exports. Specialty chemicals were particularly strong, and one contact noted that pharmaceutical manufacturers were changing from air to ocean transport as rising fuel costs drive up air freight rates. Both auto exports and imports were robust. Furniture and flooring imports were up overall, and imports of auto parts remained solid. Port administrators commented that more manufacturers were evaluating plans for moving product through the ports as they plan to shift production to this country. Some port officials are considering how to better accommodate large container ships coming to the East Coast via the Suez Canal. Those ships have nearly double the container capacity of ships that could pass through the Panama Canal. However, one port contact expressed concern that the current truck driver shortage could slow container shipping.
richmond|Retail|2013|6|sales varied by category but were flat overall since our last report. Several contacts told us the unusually cool spring weather held down sales. ers commented that their labor costs were rising as a result of the healthcare legislation, leading them to change employees' hours. The manager at a discount chain store in the Tidewater region of Virginia noted that her store was "struggling" to make sales goals. In contrast, a central Virginia retail contact observed "less of a roller coaster" in retail sales than a year ago, noting stability and even strength in categories related to home building and home sales, such as furnishings and decorative accessories. Auto dealers reported that availability of used cars improved since our last report. Auto sales remained generally strong for both domestic and imports. Surveyed contacts indicated that retail price increases slowed in recent weeks.
richmond|Services|2013|6|We received reports of renewed vigor at non-retail services firms. Architectural and technology services were among the firms noting increased revenues. A financial services contact commented that his clients were "feeling good" as asset values rose and real estate improved, leading them to free up and move cash. Although healthcare organizations reported stable demand, executives in some areas remarked on financial pressure from the decline in their Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act. Prices at non-retail services firms edged up slightly faster.
richmond|Finance|2013|6|Reports on banking conditions varied since our last assessment. Demand increased for residential mortgages. Refinancing was strong in North Carolina, whereas lending in Virginia went primarily to new home purchases. Across the District, the limited increase in commercial mortgage activity was generally confined to refinancing existing loans from other institutions. Nevertheless, a bank official in North Carolina noted a pick up in demand from home builders, and said that his bank was reconsidering whether their credit standards were too tight given the improving economy. The demand for commercial and industrial loans was weak, according to lenders in South Carolina and West Virginia, due to customers' high cash balances and low confidence. However, bankers in North Carolina and Virginia saw an uptick in activity. Several lenders commented that competitors continued to offer very low rates that "made no sense" in an attempt to take away business.
richmond|Real Estate|2013|6|Residential real estate activity strengthened in recent weeks. A contact in Hampton Roads, Virginia reported that contracts were up twenty-two percent over a year ago and that inventories were low. She added that buyers were looking for owner-occupied homes in good condition and noted that multiple offers were driving up prices. Similarly, a Realtor in the Washington, D.C. area described the market as "accelerating," noting that decreasing inventory had led to multiple offers and higher selling prices. A Richmond Realtor mentioned that new construction demand had increased, which had pushed up the prices of building lots. A homebuilder in South Carolina reported an increase in lot shortages. His company raised prices on single family homes this year to offset supplier price increases.
richmond|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|6|Fluctuating temperatures coupled with heavy rainfall tempered plant growth and delayed spring plantings throughout the District. Despite wet conditions, forage crops were having a great spring, and pastures and hayfields were in good condition.
richmond|Labor Markets|2013|6|Labor activity was uneven, although contacts were upbeat about additional hiring in the months ahead. A manufacturer in North Carolina laid off employees because of fewer federal orders. However, an auto dealer in the Washington, D.C. area noted that he had to hire more sales people, and a flooring manufacturer said he added an additional large crew at one of his plants. A national trucking firm executive remarked that implementation of new federal restrictions on driver hours of service will exacerbate the shortage of drivers for long-haul trucking. Further, a temp agency in Maryland saw somewhat stronger demand for workers in most industries. Contacts in the tourism industry indicated that seasonal hiring was about on par with a year ago, and permanent jobs were plentiful in locations along the outer banks of North Carolina. Looking ahead, firms in several categories expected to increase hiring. For example, a lumber firm expected to hire more workers later this year, and a West Virginia manufacturer planned to add jobs early next year as a result of reshoring. According to our latest surveys, manufacturing employment edged down and average wage growth slowed. Retail employment declined, but wage increases were more prevalent. Hiring flattened at non-retail services providers, while average wages rose.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2013|6|Consumer spending rose slightly in late April and early May, with an increase in retail and tourism spending and a decline in automobile and restaurant sales. Contacts in all sectors expected consumer spending to improve substantially over the next three months. District retail sales grew at a slightly faster pace over the survey period, with appliance and seasonal bridal purchases particularly strong. Tourism activity also rose, and hotel occupancy rates moved sharply higher due to an increase in tourists and business travelers. Average daily room rates moved higher and were expected to rise slightly in the months ahead. Restaurant sales declined slightly since the last survey but were expected to improve over the next few months. Automobile dealers reported fewer sales, increased inventories and fewer incentives offered. However, the majority of dealers still expected faster sales growth in the coming months due to pent-up demand, low interest rates and increased consumer confidence.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|6|After contracting for seven months, District manufacturing activity increased modestly in May. Contacts reported a rise in production, shipments and new orders, though hiring activity and average employee work weeks continued to decrease. Manufacturing expectations were strong for the coming six months, led by optimism for increased shipments, new orders, production, and capital spending. High-tech service firms reported that sales activity and capital spending increased modestly in late April and early May, and were expected to grow over the next three months. Transportation activity slowed with some contacts reporting weather disruptions affecting the industry. Many transportation contacts reported that they planned to adjust cost structures and hiring practices to offset anticipated health care and fuel cost increases.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2013|6|Residential real estate activity remained strong, and commercial real estate improved modestly in late April and early May. Residential real estate sales continued to rise sharply. Prices trended upward and inventories are lower compared to the prior survey period. District contacts reported that low inventories have slowed sales and put upward pressure on prices in some areas. They also reported concerns that appraisals were not keeping pace with price increases. Contacts expected residential sales and prices to increase further, supported by low interest rates and a rise in consumer confidence. As a result of improved sales activity and higher traffic of potential buyers, many agencies hired additional real estate agents over the past month or expected to hire in coming months. Residential builders reported steady construction activity with expectations of moderate growth over the next three months.  Commercial real estate activity rose modestly during the past month. Construction activity strengthened and prices and sales inched up, while vacancy rates fell slightly. Contacts expected stronger activity in coming months, noting that several future projects are currently in planning stages. Optimism differed across District states, with commercial real estate construction in Oklahoma expected to be particularly strong, and construction in New Mexico and Missouri fairly soft.
kansas_city|Banking|2013|6|In the recent survey period, bankers generally reported slightly stronger loan demand, improving loan quality, and steady deposit levels. Respondents, on average, reported stable demand for residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer installment loans, while demand for commercial and industrial loans increased modestly. All bankers reported steady or improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and they expected the outlook for loan quality to either improve or remain the same over the next six months. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and respondents reported average deposit levels remained stable. Bankers reported that the main factors driving positive expectations for future activity were continued economic improvements and increased consumer confidence.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2013|6|Farm income growth softened since the last survey period, and farmland value gains moderated slightly. Farm income growth was limited by falling crop and livestock prices and by high production costs, particularly for fertilizer, seed and livestock feed and forage. Crop prices fell in early April with an announcement that grain supplies were higher than earlier estimates, although some District contacts expressed concerns about crop progress. Winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further with much of the crop in relatively poor condition. The corn and soybean crops were behind schedule as unseasonably cold weather and late snows delayed spring planting in many areas. Demand for new farm loans remained weak, and contacts reported fewer requests for farm loan renewals and extensions. Farmland values continued to rise, but at a slightly slower pace than last year.
kansas_city|Energy|2013|6|activity was stable over the survey period, while expectations for future activity improved. Overall, drilling activity held steady for both oil and natural gas in late April and early May. District contacts reported that drilling in areas rich with natural gas liquids was particularly strong over the past month, and that they expected drilling activity for both oil and natural gas to pick up further in coming months. Wyoming coal production held steady in late April and early May, though demand has weakened over the past year with a shift toward coal alternatives for power generation due to low natural gas prices and environmental regulations. Ethanol production rebounded since the previous survey period due to lower corn prices and steadily improving profit margins.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2013|6|Wage pressures increased slightly but remained weak during the survey period, while prices rose for raw materials and most finished goods across industries. Labor shortages and wage pressures inched up, with strong demand for skilled workers including technicians, truck drivers, engineers and software developers. Many employers remained concerned about the impact of recent healthcare legislation on labor costs and how these costs might be passed onto consumers or impact profit margins. Retail prices increased moderately over the survey period, and retailers planned to raise prices at a similar pace over the next few months. Food costs continued to rise, and restaurant owners increasingly expected to raise menu prices in response. Similarly, raw material prices rose moderately for manufacturers. While finished goods prices remained fairly flat over the survey period, manufacturers planned to raise finished good prices over the next few months to partially offset higher input costs. Builders and construction supply firms continued to report higher prices for construction materials, particularly lumber. In some cases, construction supply costs rose faster than anticipated, which resulted in more frequent price adjustments and reduced margins. Transportation firms also noted an increase in input prices.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|10|Overall price inflation for final goods and services was modest during the reporting period. Contacts noted additional price declines for energy inputs, particularly oil, but slight upticks in the costs of assorted raw materials. The combination of weak final demand and robust competition by firms continued to hold down final prices for a wide range of goods and services.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|10|Retail sales expanded overall. Despite contact reports of deteriorating consumer sentiment, sales improved for both traditional department stores and discount chains alike. By contrast, sales were largely flat for grocers and retailers of major appliances, furniture, and electronics. Sales of new automobiles improved substantially, as demand growth was met by restocked inventories for some brands that had struggled with shortages resulting from the natural disaster in Japan earlier this year. In response to the surge in demand for new autos, the demand for used vehicles weakened somewhat and their prices softened. Despite recent gains, contacts expect that overall consumer spending in the final months of the year will be little changed from the same period last year.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|10|activity in the District showed modest gains on balance during the reporting period of September through early October. Makers of commercial aircraft and parts reported ongoing growth in new orders, which combined with an existing backlog to keep production rates near capacity. Apparel makers noted an increase in new orders, and production activity grew for food manufacturers. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products reported further moderation in the pace of growth for new orders and sales, although capacity utilization rates stayed quite high. Capacity utilization rates also remained largely stable for petroleum refiners, despite increased distillate demand, as they strived to reduce elevated product inventories. Demand remained feeble for manufacturers of wood products used for construction, and this was accompanied by recent signs of weakness in the pulp and paper sector, which had reported growth earlier this year.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|10|Demand continued to expand for agricultural products, and activity overall improved somewhat for metal miners and extractors of natural resources used for energy production. Final sales and orders rose further for assorted crops and livestock products, and reports indicated little change in the cost and availability of inputs. High price levels for assorted metals continued to boost production and investment in the District's mining sector. Extraction activity for natural gas was little changed from the prior period, while overall demand for crude oil improved somewhat as a result of rising foreign demand, particularly from emerging-market economies.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|10|District home demand remained quite weak, and demand for commercial real estate was largely unchanged. The pace of home sales stayed sluggish throughout the District. The large number of distressed properties kept inventories of available homes high, putting downward pressure on prices and the pace of new home construction. In response to weak home demand, however, demand for residential rentals continued to improve, spurring expanded construction of multifamily units in some areas. Demand for commercial real estate was generally weak, as reflected in elevated vacancy rates for office and industrial space in most parts of the District. Furthermore, contacts noted a renewed sense of caution on the part of some business tenants and consequent reluctance to commit to long-term leases. On the other hand, conditions continued to improve for some major District markets, with rising investor demand for well-leased office buildings further boosting property values.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|10|District banking contacts reported that loan demand was little changed from the prior reporting period. Businesses in general remained highly cautious in regard to their capital spending plans, citing recently elevated levels of uncertainty about the direction of the economy. As a result, demand for commercial and industrial loans was largely flat, although some contacts noted that competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses continued to intensify, placing further downward pressure on rates and fees. Demand for consumer credit was characterized as stable. Lending standards remained relatively restrictive for most types of business and consumer loans.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2011|10|First District retailers contacted in late September and early October provide mixed messages about sales trends and many note they are having a difficult time gauging their current circumstances. On a year-over-year basis, sales range from being down 3 percent to up 8 percent, with several in the "generally flat" middle. One big-ticket retailer saw sales steadily moving up over the last few weeks, although he cautions that a few weeks do not constitute a trend. Another retailer notes that sales have been up and down, on both a daily and a weekly basis, and attributes this volatility to consumer sentiment gyrating with positive and negative news about the domestic and global economy. Furniture sales are reportedly up a bit in some markets and apparel sales are said to be good. Some retailers still face "high" vendor prices and say they are passing them on to consumers. Contacts are uncertain about what to expect for the 2011 holiday sales season. Firms say they are budgeting about 2.5 percent wage increases for 2012, are hiring selectively, and are not planning layoffs.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|10|Business conditions at contacted manufactures are mixed. Most respondents continue to report revenue growth, but the vast majority also report that they are less optimistic about the next six to eighteen months than they were the last time they responded. Demand continues to be strong for firms in the automotive and aerospace components industries, as well as for a medical device firm, a semiconductor firm, and companies manufacturing industrial-related products. In comparison, sales growth remains positive but slow at an instruments manufacturer, a business services firm, and a company that makes entertainment products. Reasons contacts give for this sluggish demand include continued tepid sales to government-related institutions and financial services firms being very cautious about their expenditures. Demand was noticeably lower than in previous quarters--beyond the typical slowdown during the summer months--at a food products manufacturer. In addition, a business products firm and a manufacturer whose sales are dependent on the residential investment sector report even weaker demand than in the previous quarter.
boston|Selected Business Services|2011|10|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report generally strong business conditions, although weaker than three months ago. Marketing and advertising contacts report robust growth--between 10 percent and 25 percent year-over-year. The higher end of the growth figures are driven by demand from financial firms, including private equity, who need to market new products in the changing financial and regulatory environment. Strategy and business consulting contacts report weaker demand in the third quarter than earlier in the year; they say clients are focusing on services that can be directly tied to the bottom line such as sales and process efficiency rather than strategy and management. Economic consulting firms report varying degrees of success, with firms doing government work experiencing stagnant demand, while firms focused on litigation see strong growth (close to 20 percent) reflecting growing caseloads involving large financial firms and the financial crisis. A healthcare consulting firm cites growth of only 2 percent year-over-year, attributing it to weakness in the pharmaceutical industry, with most growth coming from developing countries.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|10|Reports from commercial real estate contacts around the District contain a mix of good news and bad. On the good news side, in both Boston and Providence significant amounts of office space were absorbed in the third quarter as tenants took advantage of attractive rents for prime locations. In the column of bad news, the outlook turned more pessimistic among roughly half of contacts in light of a perceived increase in national and global risks to growth. Respondents also report a number of other mixed or contradictory signals. While one contact perceives that leasing activity in downtown Boston has increased in recent weeks, another contact notes that the pace of office absorption year-to-date in Boston, while positive, remains well below what would be expected in a healthy recovery. Sales activity remains limited in Providence, while Boston continues to enjoy robust investment demand for prime office and apartment properties. The lending environment is characterized, on the one hand, by aggressive competition to fund loans on low-risk properties, such as well-leased buildings in prime Boston locations, and, on the other hand, by a decline in credit availability for properties carrying higher risk, such as those experiencing high vacancy rates. Construction activity in Boston continues at a moderate pace in the apartment, education, and health sectors, while office construction activity is described as negligible.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|10|Notwithstanding substantial increases in home and condo sales in August compared to a year ago, residential real estate markets in New England remain weak and sluggish. Contacts note that the enormous decline in buyer activity last year following the expiration of the tax credit largely explains the year-over-year increases observed this year. Meanwhile, the median sale prices of homes and condos decreased slightly in August throughout the region, with the exception of the Greater Boston area where prices rose. Inventory levels in Greater Boston reached very low levels in August. Residential respondents throughout New England describe buyers as cautious and patient, reflecting fears over job security. Some contacts express concern about the ability of consumers to secure home-purchase financing. At the same time, several contacts note an increase in investors purchasing single-family properties to rent out.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|10|Consumer spending grew moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in September increased over 5 percent compared with a year earlier. A manager at a Minneapolis area mall reported that traffic in August and September has been busy, while a mall manager in Montana said "back-to-school" traffic in August and September was steady. A Minnesota bar and restaurant chain reported that recent sales were up about 3 percent from a year earlier. A Minnesota supermarket chain noted that consumers continued to trade downward from high-end products to value-oriented products. Auto dealers in southern Minnesota reported that sales were bouncing back to stronger levels; consumers who put off purchases over the past couple of years are now needing to buy a different vehicle.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|10|Commercial construction activity increased slightly since the last report. The value of commercial building permits in September increased from a year ago in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area. Commercial construction in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan increased recently, according to a labor official. In Minnesota, a telecommunications equipment provider is building a large addition. In Montana, an agricultural supplier plans to expand its research center. However, a survey by a Minnesota building contractors association revealed a slight decline in activity over the past month. Residential construction increased. A bank director noted strong building activity in North Dakota. The value of residential building permits in September increased from last year in the Sioux Falls area. A large developer announced plans to build a $100 million apartment tower in downtown Minneapolis. However, the value of residential building permits in September decreased from last year in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
minneapolis|Services|2011|10|Professional business services firms reported increased activity over the past three months. About half of services firms that responded to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey saw increased sales, while 27 percent saw decreased sales. Respondents noted that profits were also up, and they expect increased activity over the next three months. A Minnesota software company experienced double-digit revenue growth over the past two months. A recent survey of 47 Minnesota architects and engineers revealed increased activity over the past month.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|10|District manufacturing activity increased since the last report. A survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed an increase in manufacturing activity in Minnesota and the Dakotas in September. An ammunition producer is expanding its operations in Minnesota. An industrial heater producer has expanded operations into a formerly shuttered vehicle plant in North Dakota. In South Dakota, a plastic sheeting producer is expanding its production facility, an electronics producer opened a new plant and a new slaughterhouse should be completed in November after a delay of several years.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|10|Activity in the energy and mining sectors continued at a strong pace. Late-September oil exploration activity increased from mid-August. A company announced plans to begin working on a $300 million wind power plant in southwestern North Dakota. District iron ore mines continued to operate at near capacity. Activity at Montana mines remains strong, driven by high metals prices, according to contacts.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|10|Ninth District farmers are expecting smaller harvests this year, but prices remain elevated. An early frost in late September may reduce corn and soybean yields around the District. Recent dry weather has been a boon to wheat harvesters, but overall wheat production in District states is expected to be about 15 percent lower than last year, according to U.S. Department of  estimates. Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat, dairy products, poultry and hogs fell slightly since the last report; cattle prices increased recently. In spite of these recent declines, prices for many District agricultural commodities remained well above their year-earlier levels.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|10|Hiring at district companies increased slightly. A Minnesota firm that provides automation technologies and services to the oil and gas industries announced plans to add 100 workers. A bank will add 90 workers in Minnesota to deal with a surge in refinancing. A mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was having some difficulty hiring 90 additional workers. A North Dakota bus plant will add over 50 workers, and a South Dakota health care record processing company will hire 20 new workers. According to a survey of construction-related firms in Minnesota, 18 percent expect to increase hiring in 2012, while 33 percent expect to decrease hiring; nevertheless, these responses were more optimistic than last year's survey.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|10|Production at District factories during the past six weeks was mainly stable along seasonal trends, with minor declines in new orders and backlogs. Compared to year-ago levels, output was moderately higher. Most of our contacts expect near-term weakening in demand, but not to levels seen in the last recession. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume was flat or somewhat higher. Shipments are being driven by transportation, energy, and industrial-equipment-related industries. Steel reps are cautious in their outlook but remain hopeful that current volume can be maintained. District auto production rose significantly in August on a month-over-month basis due to production starts on the 2012 models and the abatement of supply disruptions from Japan. Year-over-year output also rose, but the increase was limited to domestic nameplates.
cleveland|Construction|2011|10|Single-family home construction remains at a low level; however, several builders noted a recent pick up in traffic and inquiries. Sales contracts were evenly distributed across price-point categories. Half of our contacts reported that constructing and managing multi-family developments now accounts for most of their work. One contractor remarked that his business has shifted to renovating foreclosed houses and renting them. A few builders reported that they would like to increase their spec inventory, but it remains difficult to obtain financing. Expectations call for little change in residential building in the near term. Not much difference was seen in the list prices or discounting of new homes since our last report, while building material prices showed normal fluctuations. We heard comments about subcontractors attempting to raise their prices to cover rising costs, but these attempts were mainly unsuccessful. General contractors added slightly to their payrolls. Any increases in take-home pay are being offset by substantial increases in health insurance premiums.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|10|Retailers described their sales for the period from mid-August through late September as slightly higher than during the previous six weeks. On a year-over-year basis, transactions also improved, mainly in the low single digits. Many of our contacts reported that customers were particularly interested in items that are new and innovative. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, retailers expect sales to rise in the low- to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis; however, grocers anticipate little change. We continued to hear about some upward pressure on supplier prices, although it mainly affects food products and items manufactured from cotton. In response, retailers were selective about the amount of the price pressures they passed through to consumers. Reports on profit margins were mixed. Capital budgets remain as planned. Half of our contacts said that outlays are higher than a year ago, and that they are used mainly for remodeling, constructing new stores, and e-commerce infrastructure. Little change in payrolls is expected at existing stores.
cleveland|Banking|2011|10|Demand for business loans showed a moderate improvement, with requests being driven mainly by commercial real estate, manufacturing, and healthcare. Reports indicated downward pressure on interest rates for commercial credit. On the consumer side, bankers reported that applications for home equity lines of credit have declined, and they characterized installment loan activity as flat or down. However, direct and indirect auto lending continued to show strength. Applications for refinancing residential mortgages have picked up due to lower interest rates, with little activity in new purchases. No changes were made to loan application standards. Since our last report, many of our contacts have experienced substantial growth in core deposits from consumers and businesses. Delinquencies were mainly steady or declined across loan categories. Payrolls were stable, with only very selective hiring expected for the remainder of the year.
cleveland|Energy|2011|10|Conventional oil and natural gas drilling and production were fairly stable during the past six weeks, while activity in Marcellus and Utica shales expanded. A few producers expect output from conventional wells to increase in the upcoming months. Wellhead prices paid to independent producers remain on a downward trend. Little change in coal output is anticipated for the remainder of this year and into 2012. Spot prices for coal increased slightly. Capital outlays are on target, with moderate increases projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming months for drilling new wells. The cost of production equipment and materials was flat during the past six weeks.  payrolls held steady.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|10|Overall, freight transport volume continued on a slight upward trend, with increases seen in consumer products, including furniture. Most of our contacts expect volume to grow at a slow, steady pace in the near term. Although diesel fuel prices have moderated, a few contacts noted that their companies still have a fuel surcharge in place. Truck maintenance costs continued to rise. Two of our respondents have successfully increased their shipping rates as customer contracts came up for renewal. Capital outlays have accelerated during 2011 relative to prior-year levels. Spending is mainly to replace aging equipment and to support demand growth from energy customers. One executive noted that newer engines and class 8 trucks are increasing in price, and that it is becoming more difficult to secure financing. Hiring has been largely for driver replacement; however, we heard a couple of reports about carriers adding capacity. Wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|10|District retailers reported that sales decelerated slightly in September compared with the August results. Reports were mixed among contacts with half noting that sales were below plan and the remainder was evenly split between those reporting sales at or above expectations. On a year-over-over basis, sales were generally higher although traffic was lower. Most contacts anticipated that holiday sales would be similar to 2010 results. Auto dealers reported that sales continued to increase.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|10|Residential brokers indicated that sales softened somewhat in September compared with the previous month and were flat to slightly up compared with very weak levels from last year. Florida brokers reported that home sales growth slowed. Outside of Florida, Southeast brokers noted a modest pickup in sales growth. Cash purchases by investors, second home buyers, international buyers, and retirees accounted for much of the sales activity across most of the Southeast, according to contacts. Existing home prices remained below year earlier levels. District brokers anticipate only modest sales growth over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|10|Overall, manufacturers indicated a modest decline in new orders and production levels in September. In addition, fewer contacts noted plans to raise production in the near term. Energy exploration and extraction firms cited investing more in capital goods, which is expected to help equipment producers and suppliers. Auto manufacturers reported that the impact from the disaster in Japan had waned and that production is back to normal. Firms stated that they were increasing investment in technology-based equipment as a means to increase efficiency.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|10|Banking contacts indicated continued weak loan demand. Loan growth remains a concern for banks in the Sixth District. Lending levels continued to fall as new opportunities remained highly elusive and very competitive. Deposits increased as people and businesses added to their savings. The majority of large firms continued to have ready access to cash and lines of credit, while some small firms and many new firms that sought credit continued to experience difficulty. There were reports of non-bank entities, like private equity firms and groups of wealthy individuals, becoming increasingly interested in small business lending.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|10|Employers continued to manage their labor supply very tightly. Most contacts indicated that the outlook for hiring remained restrained by modest expectations regarding future sales. Several reports suggested that permanent employees were primarily being used to maintain a firm's core business, while specific projects were being assigned to contractors and temporary hires. Firms continued to seek efficiency gains through investment in technology and other cost-saving applications. Hiring contacts highlighted having difficulties finding qualified candidates for specialized positions, in some cases, because of a lack of geographic mobility for potential hires. For lower wage positions, agencies reported numerous employment opportunities; however, the positions were contingent on passing skills tests and/or background checks, which many applicants failed.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|10|District oil and gas production declined in early September as energy producers reduced offshore operations and vacated staff in the path of Tropical Storm Lee in the Gulf of Mexico. Industry contacts indicated that plans to invest in increased production capacity were proceeding. In particular, contacts reported that new drilling technology had reduced costs and increased extraction capabilities for both oil and gas.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|10|Non-auto retailers report that same store sales were mostly on or ahead of plan in August and September and moderately ahead of a year earlier. A number of contacts describe back-to-school sales as fairly strong. One major mall in western New York State notes that a large flow of Canadian shoppers has contributed significantly to strong overall sales. While stores across much of the District had fairly widespread disruptions from Hurricane Irene, the effects were relatively brief and there was little or no net effect on sales or bottom line. Inventories are generally reported to be in good shape, though one chain describes them as a bit high. While some retailers reported sizable price increases for cotton-based apparel, others indicated that they have held off on such increases thus far; prices of other retail goods were generally reported to be steady to down slightly.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|10|Residential construction remains moribund, particularly for single-family homes. Home sales have picked up a bit in parts of the District but remain weak overall, while the rental market has continued to strengthen. The housing market in northern New Jersey remains sluggish: with a dearth of new home construction, aside from some development of rental projects, the inventory of distressed properties has declined slightly but remains large; sales volume remains sluggish, and home prices have held steady and appear to have bottomed out. After a strong July and August, sales of Manhattan apartments tapered off in September; while co-op sales have been relatively sluggish, condominium sales have been buoyed by foreign buyers. The inventory of available newly-constructed condos has declined considerably in recent months but remains elevated. The lowering of the jumbo mortgage threshold from $730,000 to $625,500 on October 1st appears to have had little effect on the market. Overall, co-op and condo prices remain essentially flat. New York City's rental market continues to strengthen. Net effective rents (which take into account landlord concessions that were prevalent a year ago but are now rare) are up roughly 5 percent from a year ago, with steeper increases at the high end of the market. Realtors in western New York State note that market conditions have improved slightly, with sales picking up and prices up slightly from a year ago.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|10|A financial industry contact notes that securities firms have not been doing well recently, with all major business lines--including sales & trading, underwriting, and IPOs--weakening. Declining profits, along with uncertainty about the regulatory environment, are reportedly causing firms to pull back on hiring and compensation; some layoffs are also anticipated in this industry the months ahead. More generally, a major New York City employment agency reports that the job market has improved a bit since Labor Day but is still sluggish; hiring activity is described as not terrible but not great--again partly reflecting weakness in the financial sector. In other sectors, though, labor market conditions have been steady to slightly stronger since the last report. Two major retail chains indicate that they plan to hire more seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday season than in 2010. Both manufacturers and firms in a variety of service sectors indicate that employment levels have been steady since the last report, and that they plan to increase headcounts over the next six months.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|10|Bankers' responses suggest increased demand for residential and commercial mortgages and no change in demand for consumer loans or commercial and industrial loans. Increased demand was most prevalent for residential mortgages, where three times as many bankers indicated an increase as a decrease in demand. Much of this appears to reflect increased refinancing activity. Bankers report some slight tightening of credit standards for commercial and industrial loans, but in other loan categories, almost all contacts indicated no change in standards. Respondents report a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--especially commercial mortgages. Respondents also indicated widespread decreases in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers indicate a modest decrease in delinquency rates for residential mortgages, but a slight increase in delinquencies for commercial and industrial loans. No change was indicated in other loan categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|10|Consumer spending was up moderately in September. Auto sales were higher, due in part to increased incentives. On balance, non-auto retail sales were essentially flat, though there were considerable differences in sales growth across types of goods. For instance, spending on electronics and appliances was up, while spending on furniture and apparel was down. Sales of luxury goods continued to show some strength, and sales in the lower price ranges of essential goods like personal care items and groceries also rose. Retailers' outlook for consumer spending remained very uncertain; and several contacts indicated that lower consumer confidence and spending fatigue after heavier-than normal-promotions during the back-to-school season had made them less optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|10|Business spending increased slightly in September. Several manufacturing and construction contacts reported purchasing equipment, with the incentive to take advantage of a higher level of accelerated tax depreciation set to expire at year-end adding to the expected benefits of expanding capacity and improving efficiency. A few manufacturers who anticipated stronger demand also reported building inventories of raw materials now due to concerns about potential long lead times for these inputs in the future. In contrast, retailers were closely monitoring inventories, and some were paring them back. Hiring remained slow. A staffing firm noted slower growth of billable hours for staffing and professional services. In contrast, shortages of qualified candidates were reported in healthcare, information technology, engineering, and skilled manufacturing trades. These were most problematic in manufacturing, and many manufacturers indicated that they were addressing the shortfalls through training programs (including cross-training) for new and existing employees. Looking ahead, a recruitment firm indicated that many employers have lowered their expectations for staffing needs in the coming year. Retail contacts expected minimal seasonal hiring this holiday season, and instead planned to lengthen the workweek for permanent workers.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2011|10|Construction activity was again subdued in September. Residential real estate conditions remained weak; builders reported very little new single-family home construction and showroom traffic remained steady at a low level. Mortgage refinancing, however, picked up with the recent declines in mortgage rates. Nonresidential construction was little changed, on balance. Contacts noted an increase in industrial demand, in particular from manufacturing and distribution clients, whereas demand from the retail sector leveled off. Commercial real estate conditions improved slightly, with vacancy rates edging down, rents stabilizing, and incentives to attract new tenants increasing. Subleasing activity also rose, with contacts noting an increase in seasonal demand for short-term sublets in strip malls.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|10|production rebounded in September, with new orders and order backlogs increasing. Demand for heavy equipment was strong, led by robust activity in the construction, energy, and mining sectors. Contacts attributed much of the pick-up in construction equipment to replacement of dealer rental fleet inventory, which they expect to continue moving forward. Demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks also increased. Auto production was higher in September, reflecting rebuilding of inventories. District auto suppliers reported that recent orders had exceeded expectations along with concerns of being able to meet any additional demand in the near-term. Capacity utilization in the steel industry remained elevated. Production of industrial metals was up, while manufacturers of consumer products reported some softening. Activity for food processors continued to be robust. Contacts were cautiously optimistic about near-term prospects, pointing to continued gains in productivity, strength in demand from Asia and Brazil, and increased sales to local manufacturers looking to shorten their supply chains in the aftermath of the disruptions caused by the Japanese disasters in the spring. However, they remained concerned about the global economic outlook, with several noting a reluctance to expand capacity given elevated uncertainty.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|10|Credit conditions tightened further in September. Volatility in financial markets remained elevated, although it was lower than in August. Corporate funding costs edged higher, particularly for financial firms, even though benchmark interest rates moved lower. Banking contacts noted softer business and consumer loan demand, as clients were pulling back on spending in light of increased risks coming from Europe and the weakness in U.S. economic activity. Most lending activity was still in the form of refinancing, which picked up with lower long-term interest rates. In another positive sign, contacts noted an increase in M&A activity among middle-market firms, even with the increase in spreads and lower liquidity in the high yield and term loan markets.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|10|Raw materials prices declined, but continued to put pressure on costs in September. Prices for industrial metals like copper and steel eased further, but contacts again reported extended lead times for specialty metals as well as some shortages. Energy prices were also lower, and fuel surcharges began to decline. Conversely, retailers indicated that wholesale price pressures intensified, with food prices still elevated and prices for cotton-based goods rising. While some retailers continued to absorb some of these higher costs in their margins, pass-through to downstream prices increased. Wage pressures remained moderate.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|10|Harvest conditions varied across the District. Some parts were experiencing a slower-than-usual harvest due to late planting or fall rains that degraded crop quality. Other portions of the District were experiencing a fairly normal harvest. Corn and soybean yields appeared to be lower and more variable than a year ago. Nonetheless, yields were adequate to replenish inventories to levels that eased worries about shortages. Inventories also were boosted over the summer by lower exports and reduced usage of crops for livestock feed. Corn and soybean prices did back off during the reporting period; however, a sizeable portion of the crop had been sold prior to this decline. Lower prices for feedstocks provided relief to livestock operators. Prices for milk and hogs declined while cattle price rose; all three remained above the levels of a year ago. Farmland values and cash rental rates continued to rise in the District.
dallas|Prices|2011|10|Price pressures eased slightly since the last report. Most firms said input prices were unchanged or down, although retailers noted some increases in apparel and jewelry prices. Raw materials prices were flat or down. The exception was food producers who noted increased prices for some inputs. Contacts in the agricultural sector said commodity prices moved down since the last report.
dallas|Labor Market|2011|10|Employment levels held steady at most responding firms, although there were several reports of slight hiring activity. Staffing firms continued to note steady demand at high levels. Most primary metals manufacturers reported increases in payrolls and some continue to look for additional workers. Scattered reports of hiring came from contacts in the legal, auto sales, airline and transportation manufacturing industries. Contacts in food manufacturing and financial services said hiring activity had abated. Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure was noted by select retail, lumber and transportation manufacturing firms.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|10|Reports were mixed among construction-related firms, but most contacts described demand as steady during the reporting period. Several responding firms said ongoing public projects were buoying activity. Fabricated metals firms noted a slight pickup in demand and two lumber producers noted a pickup believed to be due to home improvement projects and demand from homebuilders. Construction-related outlooks were mostly unchanged, with a slow recovery expected.
dallas|Retail Sales|2011|10|Retail sales growth slowed over most of the reporting period, but picked up in the final weeks of September. A long hot summer led to delayed fall clothing purchases, however contacts said cooler weather recently spurred seasonal sales. The higher end of the market continues to fare better than lower price point offerings. Eleventh District growth trended roughly in line with the nation, according to one large retailer. Expectations are for modest growth this holiday season.
dallas|Services|2011|10|Overall demand for staffing services continued to hold steady at high levels. One contact noted a slight pull back that was characterized as "fear driven." Direct hires continue to outpace temporary placements. Outlooks were mixed, with half of the respondents more cautious and half more positive. Even contacts with positive outlooks expressed concern about the upcoming election cycle and regulatory uncertainty. Accounting firms said demand for accounting services remained steady. Outlooks were unchanged, but one contact noted the next few months will be telling, as customers appear to be waiting for greater clarity about the economy and possible regulations. Demand for legal services remained unchanged.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2011|10|Contacts in the housing sector noted some improvement, although most characterize conditions as choppy. Inventories of existing homes declined since the last report, and new home inventories remain lean. Most contacts say sales are better, although many note the strict lending environment, along with nervousness about the path of the U.S. economy, is keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|10|Financial firms reported relatively flat loan demand overall. National banks noted modest increases in loan demand, although contacts were uncertain the gains would continue. Regional banks said loan demand was flat, and loan pricing remained competitive. Still, outstanding loan quality continued to hold up, according to contacts. The improvement in lending conditions noted in the last report has stalled, due to both the modest level of demand and more caution in supplying loans to anyone but the most creditworthy of borrowers.
dallas|Energy|2011|10|Drilling activity remains strong. Contacts in the energy sector said oil field activity is at high levels and expanding. The Texas rig count rose by 11 during the reporting period. Despite the strength, many noted concern about the recent dip in the price of oil and U.S. and global economic weakness.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|10|Drought in the Eleventh District remained severe during the reporting period, particularly in Texas where more than 85 percent of the state is in exceptional drought. Already poor grazing and stock water conditions deteriorated further, forcing many ranchers to sell off part or all of their herds. The drought caused low yields and record-high abandonment rates for some crops, including cotton. Export demand for beef continued to grow while the volume of exports for most crops was lower than six weeks ago. There was growing concern about continued drought conditions and the negative impact of low soil moisture on 2012 crop production.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|10|Manufacturing activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or reduce operations. Firms in the automobile, railroad rolling stock, ceramic product, automobile parts, sanitary paper product, and appliance manufacturing industries reported plans to expand operations and hire new workers. In contrast, firms in the ammunition, primary metal, and wood manufacturing industries announced plans to lay off employees.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|10|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, August 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 6 percent in Memphis, 9 percent in St. Louis, 10 percent in Louisville, and 12 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction also continued to decrease throughout the District. August 2011 year-to-date single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 12 percent in Memphis, 19 percent in Louisville, and 24 percent in Little Rock and St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|10|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 0.8 percent in the three-month period from mid-June to mid-September. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.7 percent of total loans, decreased 1.5 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.7 percent of total loans, decreased 0.5 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.9 percent of loans, increased 2.1 percent. All other loans increased 6.3 percent and accounted for 5.7 percent of total loans. Over this period, total deposits increased 0.1 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|10|The rates of completion for the cotton, soybean, and rice harvests in the District states were behind their 5-year average. In contrast, the corn harvest was at least 5 percent ahead of schedule in the majority of the District's states. The fraction of corn, soybean and sorghum crops rated in fair or better condition declined by at least one percent in most states since the previous report. The fraction of pastures in fair or better condition increased or remained unchanged in most states, except Illinois and Missouri. The District's monthly coal production for August 2011 was 0.3 percent lower compared with August 2010; however, the District's year-to-date coal production for August 2011 was 3.5 percent higher than the same period in 2010.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|10|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers reported further decreases in new orders and shipments; however, the rate of slowdown has lessened and is less widespread. The makers of primary metals, fabricated metals, and electronic equipment reported declining product demand. However, growing product demand was reported by makers of food products, lumber and wood products, industrial machinery, and instruments, and by printers and publishers. Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee were mentioned positively (as a source of increased demand for cleanup, repairs, and emergency equipment) and negatively (for flooding, harvesting problems, and shipment delays) by almost equal numbers of firms. However, most firms were unaffected. Two key firms that supply or service manufacturers and other broad sectors have reported steady modest growth since the last Beige Book. Both anticipate stable growth from most of their clients (except defense-related firms) for the remainder of the year.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|10|For most of August and September, Third District retailers reported that sales were flat to down compared with a year earlier. However, "October started off with a bang," said one department store chain manager. Low consumer confidence and rising uncertainty were widely cited as reasons for maintaining low inventory levels as the holiday season approached. Missed profit opportunities may result if the holiday sales prove stronger than last year, but a flat to down season could force further retail store closings.
philadelphia|Finance|2011|10|At most of the Third District banks contacted for this report, total outstanding loan volume has been roughly level since the previous Beige Book. Overall, commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans have contracted somewhat. Bankers anticipate continued low consumer loan demand due to high unemployment rates and ongoing deleveraging, which has accelerated with the recent surge in refinancings. Credit quality, along with growing corporate and household cash balances, is improving. The outlook among Third District bankers interviewed in September is that total loan volume will expand only slightly over the remainder of the year.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|10|Residential real estate activity in the Third District has been mixed with sales rising, then falling since the previous Beige Book, and with builders reporting slight gains in activity. August sales figures finished up over the year, but agents reported that September would be off last year's pace. Properties are moving, but inventory remains very high. Overall, 2011 sales are expected to be lower than 2010 in all three Third District states. While trends and timing varied across states, builders reported somewhat stronger activity overall, since some distance has passed since the debt-ceiling debate. Still, sales remain difficult, and buyers noncommittal, as economic uncertainty increases. "People are really scared," said one builder. Labor and material costs have flattened, but list pricing has, as well; therefore, builders are struggling to hold margins. The industry remains cautious.
philadelphia|Services|2011|10|Third District service-sector firms have reported flat to modest growth since the last Beige Book. A logistics firm reported above-average improvement, noting some growth was seasonal. A staffing firm noted that its flat activity was marked by relatively greater interest in workers with high skills or low skills and little or no interest in workers with medium skills. The debt-ceiling agreement has increased caution for defense-related firms and may be a cause of future layoffs. These firms as well as several other large service firms reported greater efforts to expand their overseas markets, where their growth rates have been stronger. Firms remain generally positive, but very cautious, reporting that their own customers often delay decisions.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|10|Since the previous Beige Book, general price levels remain contained. Price pressures have flattened or lessened further for retailers, service-sector firms, and builders for most factor prices; however, margins remain very tight. Retailers did note increases for cotton products. Manufacturers have been reporting slightly greater price pressures and modestly greater success at passing along those costs. Rents are rising in a few select markets, but house prices remain soft or are falling, and wages pressures are low. However, reports of shortages of skilled labor may reflect unrealistically low wage offers.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|10|Consumer spending was up slightly in September. The majority of Districts reported increases in auto sales, with the largest improvements in San Francisco and New York. Several Districts noted a greater availability of new vehicles as the supply disruptions that had plagued auto dealerships in the aftermath of the Japanese disaster subsided. Contacts in the Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts indicated that demand for used cars remained high and that some models were still scarce. A large number of Districts reported that non-auto retail sales were flat to down in September; but a few, such as Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas noted an increase in customer traffic late in the month and into early October. Back-to-school sales were described as being fairly strong in New York and satisfactory in Richmond. In addition, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas cited some strength in the sales of big-ticket or luxury items, while Minneapolis and Chicago noted that more consumers were trading down to value products at grocery stores.
summary|Business Spending|2011|10|Business spending increased somewhat from the previous report. However, contacts in a number of Districts reported that a weaker and more uncertain economic outlook had increased caution and was weighing on future spending plans. Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago indicated that many retailers were reluctant to build inventories ahead of the holiday season, pointing to recent declines in consumer confidence. Auto dealers were an exception, as they continued to replenish inventories that ran low in the aftermath of the production disruptions caused by the Japanese disaster. Capital spending continued as planned in most Districts. Respondents in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago noted increased purchases of equipment in the manufacturing, mining, and transportation industries. Boston and Minneapolis indicated that some manufacturers planned to expand capacity either through mergers and acquisitions or the building of additional facilities. Atlanta cited a pick-up in corporate expansion and relocation interest, and Chicago noted an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity among middle-market firms.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|10|Reports regarding nonfinancial services were mixed in September. Richmond noted slower overall activity, and St. Louis cited reduced demand for telecommunications, media, and education services. Demand for accounting and legal services was reported to have been unchanged in both Dallas and San Francisco. On the positive side, contacts in St. Louis reported that demand for business support services increased, and Boston reported strong business conditions for economic consulting firms involved with litigation work and advertising firms helping to market financial services. In addition, San Francisco noted continued growth in demand for technology services, Minneapolis noted an increase in activity in software and engineering, and Philadelphia cited some growth in logistics. Staffing at nonfinancial service-sector firms was reported to have been up slightly in Richmond, but growth slowed in Chicago and Philadelphia reported flat activity.
summary|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|10|Contacts indicated that manufacturing and transportation activity increased since the last report in most Districts. A large number of Districts reported higher production of autos and other transportation-related equipment. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago noted increases in auto production, and Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis all cited robust activity for auto suppliers. Dallas reported healthy demand for nondefense transportation goods. Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated continued growth in commercial aviation and aerospace manufacturing. Steel production rose in Cleveland and Chicago, and in a number of Districts metal manufacturers' new orders also rose. Other areas of manufacturing were more mixed. The Dallas report noted a decline in refining activity. However, both Dallas and Atlanta continued to note robust oil and gas drilling activity, and this activity was said to be propelling demand for related equipment from suppliers in Chicago. Manufacturing of construction materials or equipment was reported to have increased some in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas but remained weak in most other Districts. Growth in high-tech manufacturing continued to be robust in Boston, but moderated in Dallas and San Francisco. Respondents reported that food production was up in Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, steady in Dallas, and lower in Boston. Manufacturers of consumer products reported a softening in orders in Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas, while new orders for apparel increased in San Francisco. Freight traffic increased in Cleveland and Atlanta, driven in large part by shipments of commodities, and Richmond also noted that port activity for commodities continued to be robust. However, Richmond also indicated that imports and exports, in particular of consumer goods, were both somewhat soft during what is typically the peak season for trade.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|10|All twelve Districts reported that real estate and construction activity was little changed on balance from the prior report. Residential construction remained at low levels, particularly for single-family homes. That said, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis noted small increases in single-family construction, and construction of multifamily dwellings continued to increase at a moderate pace in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Home sales remained weak overall, and home prices were reported to be either flat or declining across all of the Districts. In contrast, rental demand continued to rise in a number of Districts. Commercial real estate conditions remained weak overall, although commercial construction increased at a slow pace in most Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Cleveland cited some gains in demand for construction of education, healthcare, and institutional-related buildings, and New York reported an increase in hotel development. Furthermore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago noted an increase in demand for manufacturing and distribution facilities. Vacancy rates remained elevated, but Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas reported an increase in leasing activity and Philadelphia and San Francisco indicated rising investor interest in well-leased office space.
summary|Banking and Finance|2011|10|Financial activity was reported to have weakened some since the last report. Dallas noted that the improvement in financial conditions had stalled, and Chicago indicated a further tightening of credit conditions, particularly for financial firms. In addition, New York reported noticeably weaker activity in the securities industry. Loan volumes were either flat or down slightly in most Districts. Consumer loan demand moved lower according to respondents in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City, and it held steady in New York and San Francisco. However, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted an increase in mortgage refinancing activity given lower mortgage rates and Cleveland also noted continued strength in auto lending and increased demand for business loans. Meanwhile, business loan demand was described as down somewhat in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City and was little changed in most other Districts. Loan standards were described as still tight for many classes of borrowers. That said, several Districts indicated that strong competition among banks for high quality borrowers was leading to lower rates and fees for these customers.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|10|Contacts generally reported that crop conditions at harvest were less favorable than a year ago, although results varied by and within Districts. Lower yields than a year ago were reported for major crops in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts and in most of the Kansas City District. Even so, yields were large enough to alleviate worries about shortages. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices moved down, while some contacts noted higher prices for cotton. Drought conditions persisted in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, and pastures were in worse shape than a year ago in many areas. Although there were declines in feed costs, poultry and livestock producers remained pressured by drought and the cost increases of the past year. Hog, poultry, and dairy prices decreased, while cattle prices increased. Still, agricultural prices tended to be higher than a year ago, boosting farm incomes outside of drought-stricken areas. Chicago and Kansas City reported higher agricultural land values.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|10|Respondents indicated that labor market conditions were little changed, on balance, in September. Several Districts cited only limited and selective demand for new hires. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted that firms in some sectors that were hiring more broadly (such as manufacturing, transportation, and energy) were also experiencing difficulties in finding appropriately skilled or qualified labor. Respondents in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts indicated that hiring was being restrained by elevated uncertainty or lower expectations for their future growth. New York reported that deteriorating business conditions in the finance industry had led to a pull back in hiring with some layoffs anticipated in the months ahead. Richmond and Chicago reported reduced seasonal hiring in retail trade given apprehension about the strength of holiday sales, while New York indicated that seasonal hiring was likely to increase.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|10|District manufacturing activity continued to contract in September. A primary metals producer reported a dramatic falloff in their domestic orders, noting that a domestic retail chain had recently cancelled a large order. The firm expects to cut production unless orders improve immediately. Similarly, several textile and apparel manufacturers indicated that customers had reduced their purchases. Moreover, a number of furniture producers cited sluggish consumer spending, but added that corporate spending had improved somewhat since our last report. In contrast, an automotive parts maker said that underlying business was very strong. Also, a metal fabricator cited examples of improving orders, with autos and aerospace among his strongest customers. Our latest manufacturing survey showed that raw material prices grew at a considerably slower pace, while prices for finished goods changed little since our last report.
richmond|Retail|2011|10|sales generally weakened since our last report, although several merchants reported a pickup in the last week of September. Most contacts indicated that back-to-school sales were satisfactory, but for many, somewhat below expectations; a Virginia retailer commented that sales were "good, though not fantastic." Shopper traffic waned in early September but returned later in the month. A retail contact in central Virginia reported that credit-card use increased toward the end of the back-to-school season, indicating shoppers were more confident, but remarked, if consumers accumulate sizeable levels of debt now, they might spend less during the holiday season. An executive at a Virginia hardware chain also reported strong sales through September, with little difficulty passing through price increases. Looking ahead to holiday sales, a Maryland department store manager was cautiously optimistic and she expected "practical gift-giving" this year. Apprehension about the strength of holiday sales has constrained seasonal hiring for some retailers. Small merchants in some areas reported difficulty obtaining financing for inventory. Big-ticket sales continued to be soft overall, but automobile sales were steady since our last report, according to several contacts. A West Virginia auto dealer said that his sales were close to 2010 levels, while a dealer near the D.C. metro area reported a stronger month, led by imports. Average retail wages and prices increased moderately, according to our contacts.
richmond|Services|2011|10|Non-retail services providers reported slower activity. A number of services providers complained about various new government regulations and regulatory burdens on their businesses. Contacts on the southern Delmarva Peninsula expressed anxiety that new EPA regulations for the Chesapeake Bay could result in local chicken farmers losing contracts to farmers further inland, resulting in trickle-down business closures and job losses. Several executives commented that they were refraining from expansion and hiring and that they were holding cash because of uncertainty about the economy. An executive from a West Virginia engineering firm commented, "We are now in a wait-and-see mode." According to a transportation contact, freight trucking firms faced challenges in hiring long-haul drivers, as drivers opted to remain on unemployment benefits rather than accept higher income for driving long-distance routes. Prices at services firms climbed more slowly since our last report.
richmond|Finance|2011|10|Lending activity in the District was mixed over the last six weeks. Several commercial bankers in Virginia and Maryland reported moderate increases in loan demand in recent weeks, although some of the increase was from refinancing. One banker attributed an increase in loan applications to businesses shopping around to establish new bank relationships. Also, a lending officer in Richmond reported a sharp increase in loans to existing customers, because new products were now available and the approval process was faster. However, several bankers in West Virginia and the Carolinas noted a recent slowdown in home mortgage lending, following signs of improvement as recently as July. An exception was home refinancing, which benefited from lower mortgage rates, according to several sources. One commercial and industrial loan officer stated that the recent rise in economic uncertainty had caused several of his clients to pay down debt. Another banker reported that local auto dealers were borrowing less now, but were expected to increase their borrowing for new model year deliveries. Most banks continued to report improvements in credit quality, partly due to tighter credit standards. However, that tightening also contributed to a slowdown of the approval process.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|10|Residential real estate activity continued to be depressed. Several brokers reported that sales in their area had dropped and that housing prices continued to decline. A contact in Charlotte described the local real estate market as worsening, while a source from Richmond stated that new building permits were down. According to a contact in Baltimore, the housing market remained slow and short sales were getting harder to close due to tighter regulatory standards. A Realtor from Northern Virginia said that there were fewer foreclosure sales in the market, but added that short sales were still about 50 percent of her company's sales. Another Realtor in the D.C. area expected fewer sales for the upcoming season because inventory was shrinking, but said that low interest rates should keep the market active. He added that a moderate trend of sales at or above full price should continue for properties in good condition. Finally, a market analyst from the eastern Virginia area noted a modest improvement in sales activity, particularly in more urban areas. He also noted that new construction had shifted towards smaller, more energy-efficient homes.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|10|Although reports on labor market activity were varied in September, on balance their tone was more negative than in our last report. Employment agencies reported somewhat stronger demand for temporary help in recent weeks, particularly in the manufacturing sector, but indicated that finding qualified workers was becoming an increasing concern. A Virginia contact noted that one-in-five businesses were having problems finding workers with the desired skills, particularly in the manufacturing and professional business services industries. A manager of a temp agency in North Carolina stated that companies were hiring workers on a more permanent basis, but companies were taking longer to do so than in the past. A temp agency executive from the Charlotte area reported that, despite a backlog of work and employees working a lot of overtime, a manufacturer was still unwilling to hire at this time due to concerns about future demand. According to our latest survey, service sector hiring was flat over the last month. Retail sector wages were weak, while wages at service firms edged up. Hiring by manufacturers strengthened over the last month, while the average workweek eased and wage growth inched higher.
richmond|Tourism|2011|10|Following Hurricane Irene in late August, hotels and related businesses on the Outer Banks of North Carolina quickly re-opened to serve late-season travelers. The southern portion of the Outer Banks suffered extensive damage, including destruction of buildings and roadways, particularly along the Hatteras side. These tourist destinations are now closed, and many may not re-open until next spring. However, tourism remained vibrant in other areas. A hotel manager in western North Carolina reported strong bookings, both for groups and for pleasure stays. He noted that "leaf peepers" were booked for October and into November, and local holiday attractions were expected to keep bookings up through the end of the year. Hospitality contacts in Richmond and Baltimore also reported solid business. Finally, a contact said that recent international media attention on the earthquake-damaged Washington Monument has been overwhelming. He added that the new Martin Luther King Memorial was drawing huge crowds.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|10|In late August and September, consumer spending increased in the retail and auto sectors but declined slightly in the restaurant and travel sectors. District retailers reported strong sales and expected additional increases during the next three months. Luxury goods, such as jewelry and custom-upholstered furniture, sold particularly well. One contact noted an uptick in sales among both high-end and low-end customers, but reported that those in the middle were holding back. Auto sales were also higher than expected despite several contacts describing low consumer confidence due to economic and political uncertainty. Many auto dealers reported difficulty finding qualified sales people and technicians. Restaurant sales were lower than anticipated but were expected to remain steady over the next three months. Despite slightly lower average room rates, hotel occupancy decreased, and District hotel owners expected further declines in the coming months.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|10|Manufacturing and high-tech service activity continued to grow during the survey period, while transportation activity was flat. Manufacturing activity increased at durable goods factories, particularly firms producing aircraft and computer equipment. These increases helped to offset a slight decline in activity at non-durable goods plants. Shipment and new order volumes edged up during the survey period, and firms expected both to improve over the coming months. With an overall increase in activity, firms hired additional workers and slightly increased employee hours. Manufacturers continued to anticipate higher capital spending over the next six months, but these expectations were dampened somewhat compared to the previous survey. The high-tech industry reported steady growth in sales, and firms expected activity to be strong over the next three months. Transportation activity was flat during the survey period, and contacts reported continued difficulty finding skilled technicians and drivers.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|10|Residential and commercial real estate activity remained weak during late August and September. Residential sales were flat during the survey period, and home prices were down. Real estate contacts expected sales to be much slower in the coming months, but many attributed this to the seasonal slowdown. Residential mortgage lenders continued to report an increase in refinancing activity due to low mortgage rates, but very little new loan activity. Construction supply firms saw sales fall during the survey period, and they expected upcoming sales to be weak due to the seasonal slowdown of the construction industry. Housing starts were flat, and builders did not foresee activity increasing in the next three months. Multi-family building projects were the only area of reported growth by commercial construction contacts. Commercial real estate sales and prices continued to decline, and vacancy rates were flat. District contacts expected commercial prices and rents to decline further in the coming months. Developers reported no change in their access to credit.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|10|In the recent survey period, bankers reported increased deposits, but somewhat weaker loan demand and a slight deterioration in loan quality. Overall loan demand decreased slightly as demand for consumer installment loans declined, while demand for commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and residential real estate loans was marginally weaker. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and deposits increased for the sixth straight survey. Bankers reported a minor deterioration in loan quality compared to a year ago but anticipated some improvement in the outlook for loan quality over the next six months.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|10|Agricultural conditions continued to vary across the District. Northern portions of the District, which received ample rain, expected bumper crops, while crops in the southern portions of the District continued to suffer under drought conditions. Most of the corn and soybean crops in Nebraska were rated in good or better condition as harvest began, while Kansas expected yields well below average due to drought. Winter wheat planting was delayed in some areas of Oklahoma as farmers waited for rain, but planting was on schedule in Kansas and Nebraska. Despite recent downturns in crop prices, farm income expectations remained strong. Robust export demand supported livestock prices, but high feed costs trimmed profit margins. Farm loan demand remained weak as capital spending slowed further and some producers paid cash for higher input costs. District contacts indicated that prices of farmland sold at auction continued to post record highs.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|10|activity continued to expand in late August and September, and activity was expected to grow further over the next three months. The number of active drilling rigs for both oil and natural gas increased in the District. Oklahoma and Wyoming showed the largest growth in rig counts, which helped to offset slight decreases in New Mexico and Kansas. Contacts continued to report that future drilling activity was being constrained by a lack of qualified labor and the availability of equipment and supplies. Contacts reported having a difficult time attracting experienced skilled workers due to increased competition among firms. The price of crude oil was expected to decrease over the next three months, but natural gas prices were expected to increase as winter demand increases. Coal production increased slightly during the survey period.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|10|District contacts reported higher prices for both inputs and finished goods, but wage pressures eased from already low levels. More manufacturers reported increases in raw material prices and finished goods prices in September, and most expected further increases over the next six months. Input prices also rose for building materials, especially roofing materials. Prices held steady at retail stores but were expected to increase in the coming months. Restaurant contacts also anticipated raising menu prices as food prices continued to climb. Contacts from several industries reported difficulties finding qualified workers for skilled positions, but fewer firms than in recent surveys reported increasing wages in response. Across all industries, most contacts expected wage increases to remain stable over the next three months.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|8|Price inflation was limited for most final goods and services during the reporting period. Prices increased for some energy items, mainly crude oil, retail gasoline, and electricity, but natural gas prices remained near historic lows. Contacts also noted price increases for assorted food commodities, particularly grains, although meat prices reportedly have leveled off for the time being. For most products and services, vigorous competition among firms and cost-conscious purchasing behavior by consumers kept price inflation in check.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|8|Retail sales expanded a bit further overall. Respondents in general indicated that sales strengthened somewhat in July compared with softness in May and June. Performance was stronger for discount chains than traditional department stores, particularly for online sales. At grocery stores, extensive bargain hunting by shoppers caused sales revenues to weaken a bit. The pace of auto sales slowed somewhat compared with the prior reporting period, although it remained significantly above the pace from the same period last year. Used vehicles have been in short supply, raising their trade-in values and helping to spur sales of new vehicles.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|8|District manufacturing activity was mixed but appeared to inch up on balance during the reporting period of July through mid-August. Production activity remained at high levels for makers of commercial aircraft and parts. Demand continued to grow for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Output and sales strengthened a bit further for manufacturers of wood products. By contrast, the slowdown continued for makers of information technology equipment, with sales declines reported for some equipment categories in recent months. Demand for steel was mostly stable at low levels, while sales of processed scrap metal fell, largely as a result of a decline in overseas demand. For petroleum refiners, capacity utilization rates increased somewhat, as growth in export sales for a range of refined products offset weakness in domestic demand for gasoline.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|8|Agricultural producers saw further sales gains, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production continued to expand. Orders and sales grew for many crop and livestock products, and one report indicated that demand for cotton was particularly strong. The persistent drought in parts of the country has raised grain and feed prices, prompting District cattle ranchers to reduce herd sizes. Extraction activity for petroleum and natural gas remained at high levels or expanded a bit further on net, although some producers have been shifting operations away from natural gas in response to continued high inventories and the consequent low price.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|8|Home demand in the District continued to improve, while demand for commercial real estate was largely stable. Although it is still well below its historical average, the sales pace for new and existing homes picked up further in many areas, and some contacts pointed to pent-up demand that may spur additional gains. Contacts also reported that the share of foreclosures and short sales in overall home sales has been declining, and the quality of the inventory of available homes has improved. In some parts of the District, a shortage of lower-priced homes and rental units has led to an ongoing increase in construction activity, particularly for multifamily rental projects. Demand for nonresidential space was largely stable overall, with construction activity largely limited to various public projects and remodeling of commercial and industrial space.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|8|District banking contacts reported that loan demand was unchanged or down slightly on balance compared with the prior reporting period. Business loan demand appeared to drop a bit, amid growing reluctance by many firms to commit to expansion plans under current economic conditions. At the same time, the reports continued to highlight ample liquidity and stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to well-qualified business loan applicants. Demand for consumer credit remained relatively strong, reflected primarily in high lending activity for automobile and home purchases.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2012|8|First District retail contacts offer a very mixed take on economic conditions in the region. Demand remains strong for adult clothing, but spending on durable items such as furniture and electronics continues to be lower than earlier in the year. Some companies cite disappointing sales during the last six weeks, while others report some upside surprises. Sales results range from low single-digit declines to high single-digit increases compared with a year earlier. Some contacts say that consumer sentiment has become more negative, while others observe that consumers are "coming back." Retailers note wholesale prices remain flat so they are holding selling prices steady. Respondents still express uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy and say they expect little improvement over the next six to eight months.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|8|The general manufacturing picture in the First District continues to be mixed, although contacts seem to be slightly more upbeat than earlier this summer. Of 12 contacted firms, only two report lower overall sales than a year earlier: A manufacturer of semiconductors attributes the decline largely to industry-specific cycles and a software company that sells mostly into the defense business says slower sales reflect fears about impending sequestration. All other responding firms report flat or rising sales.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2012|8|New England software and information technology services contacts report flat to favorable results in the second quarter of 2012, with year-over-year revenue increases generally between 5 percent and 10 percent. Contacts report strong demand in the banking and medical sectors as well as some new activity in the automotive, telecommunications, and manufacturing sectors. However, these upticks in demand are, for many contacts, tempered by the strong dollar and economic uncertainties, particularly in Europe, which are having an increasingly negative effect on revenues. Indeed, one contact reports that revenues from Europe fell more than 50 percent over the four quarters ended in Q2, as many clients delayed execution of big license agreements. Most respondents continue to add to their headcounts, although a few have slowed the rate at which they are hiring. Capital and technology spending and selling prices have gone largely unchanged since February.
boston|Staffing Services|2012|8|New England staffing firms generally report lighter-than-expected volumes through mid-August, with most contacts characterizing business as "slow" or "flat." The May-to-August dip reportedly reflects a softening of demand for office and clerical assistants and light industrial workers. Nevertheless, year-over-year revenue changes in the second quarter remained largely positive, bolstered by steady demand from the engineering, legal, and IT sectors. The number of permanent and temporary-to-permanent placements continues to grow slowly, with one contact noting that clients are "definitely more willing to commit." Labor supply has gone largely unchanged since May. Contacts continue to have difficulty finding candidates with high-end skill sets such as mechanical and electrical engineers, software developers, and IT personnel; two contacts report that this shortage of qualified labor is putting upward pressure on pay rates and recruiting costs. Looking forward, staffing contacts are slightly less upbeat than they were 3 months ago. Most expect only modest growth until 2013.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|8|Commercial real estate fundamentals held roughly steady in recent weeks across the First District. Boston continues to enjoy strong leasing demand in pockets of the city and comparatively slow but steady activity in the Financial District. Leasing activity remains light in Hartford, where the retail sector is seen as a weak point. Activity in Providence is mixed across sectors and year-to-date has fallen short of expectations as a result of vacancy shocks. In Portland, office leasing activity is up from earlier in the year, but rents have stayed roughly flat. Across the District, a few contacts note that traditional downtown tenant types, such as law firms and large financial firms, continue to reduce square footage of office space per worker. These reductions are viewed as structural and suggest that future employment growth in professional services may lead to less absorption than previous norms of office space would imply.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|8|Sales of single-family homes and condominiums continued to grow year-over-year in June and July throughout most of the First District. However, in Connecticut, June sales increased marginally in the single-family home market and declined year-over-year in the condo market, but the latest reports for July suggest more substantial increases in Connecticut home sales. Similar to previous reports, contacts cite low interest rates and prices, in addition to pent-up demand, as significant factors in improving sales activity. According to a contact in Greater Boston, rising residential rents continue to spur interest in home ownership. Reports for July suggest the median sales price of homes rose in five of the six New England states; the exception was Rhode Island, where prices continue to decline. Contacts outside of Rhode Island cite declining inventory as the cause for modest price appreciation. Several contacts in areas with low inventory levels note some potential sellers are waiting for their homes to appreciate in value before listing them. Falling inventories in Greater Boston have prompted concern among local real estate professionals that potential homebuyers will be discouraged by an insufficient variety of homes.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|8|Consumer spending grew since the last report. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased 3 percent in July compared with a year ago; a company representative noted that back-to-school shopping activity has been positive. July same-store sales at a Montana mall increased slightly compared with a year ago. Recent same-store sales at a Minnesota-based restaurant chain were up about 7 percent compared with a year ago. New car and light truck registrations in Minnesota were more than 10 percent higher recently compared with last year. However, a higher-end retailer announced plans to close a Minnesota store next year.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|8|Commercial construction activity increased since the last report. The value of commercial building permits in the Billings, Mont., area in July more than doubled from the same period last year. Commercial permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area more than doubled in value in July from a year earlier. New industrial and warehouse building projects were in progress in the Minneapolis area. Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential building permits in the Sioux Falls area in July was up 39 percent from the same period last year. Residential permits increased in value and number in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in July; both single-family and multifamily permits increased. Several counties in Montana reported large increases in home building in 2012 compared with 2011, and the value of residential permits issued in July more than doubled in Billings.
minneapolis|Services|2012|8|Activity at professional business services firms grew somewhat since the last report. According to a mid-August Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey, District professional business services firms noted gains in revenue and profits over the past three months and expect this to continue over the next three months.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|8|activity slowed. Surprisingly, a July survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed a decrease in manufacturing activity in Minnesota and South Dakota for the first time in three years; activity in North Dakota increased, but at a slower pace than in recent months. However, most respondents to a Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey of manufacturers conducted in mid-August had a mildly optimistic outlook for the near term. Several contacts indicated that orders dropped in early July, but have returned to previous levels. A long-planned beef-packing plant in South Dakota was put on hold following reports that it would open soon. A Minnesota manufacturer that makes equipment for the scrap metal industry will reduce production due to a stagnant scrap metal market and a glut of new steel.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2012|8|The energy sector moderated somewhat. Oil and gas exploration in North Dakota decreased in early August, while it increased slightly in Montana; production remained at record levels. Producers of wind-energy components reported slow demand attributed to uncertainty over the renewal of a tax credit. A Minnesota ethanol plant was idled because of high corn input costs. A coal-fired power plant in South Dakota was also shut down. Mining activity remained steady at high levels. Minnesota iron ore mines and taconite producers continued to operate at high capacity, although some operations were idled for standard annual maintenance. Sand mines in western Wisconsin remained very busy due to strong demand from oil and gas producers.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|8|The agriculture sector was mixed. Preliminary results from the Minneapolis Fed's second-quarter (July) survey of agricultural credit conditions showed that nearly 90 percent of lenders said farm incomes increased or stayed the same in the past three months, with similar results for household and capital spending. While severe drought hit the Midwest, much of the District has been spared relative to other areas. Most of the corn, soybean and spring wheat crops in Minnesota and North Dakota were in good or excellent condition. South Dakota and Wisconsin fared somewhat worse. District cattle producers have been selling more animals because of high feed costs. Margins also tightened for dairy producers. Prices received by farmers in July increased from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, hay, dry beans, poultry, eggs, cattle and hogs; prices decreased for potatoes and dairy products.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|8|Overall labor market conditions were steady since the last report, but tightening continued for some regions and occupations. Bank directors noted that many District companies have not adjusted their hiring plans for the second half of 2012. Manufacturers throughout the District continued to have a number of welding positions open. A business process outsourcing firm recently announced plans to locate up to 400 jobs in Minnesota. A Minnesota manufacturer hired 250 workers over the past seven months. In contrast, a Minnesota food retailer plans to lay off 50 workers, and two North Dakota manufacturers are holding back on hiring plans.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|8|Representatives from District factories reported that new orders and production were flat or down slightly during the past six weeks, with inventories showing a slight uptick. Relative to year-ago levels, output was mainly higher. The outlook by manufacturers was mixed. While many contacts are less certain about growth prospects than they had been a few months earlier, others believe that the abundance of lower-priced energy, especially natural gas, will boost manufacturing activity in the District. A weakening in shipping volume by steel producers and service centers was attributed to seasonal factors, rising imports, and uncertainty. Demand for steel from the energy sector remained solid, while demand from the transportation sector softened. Most of our steel contacts do not expect market conditions to change appreciably in the upcoming months. Steel producers reported lowering their inventories. District auto production showed a substantial decline in July on a month-over-month basis, due to normal seasonal retooling for model changeovers. Compared to a year ago, production figures were unchanged for domestic producers, while showing a sizeable increase for foreign nameplates. The latter is attributable to the abatement of supply chain issues.
cleveland|Real Estate|2012|8|Reports from home-builders on single-family housing starts during July were mixed, although all of our contacts said that activity had improved compared to a year ago. Sales contracts were in all price-point categories. Homebuilders anticipate only a modest increase in the construction of single-family homes in the near term; however, opportunities for rehabilitating old buildings into apartments and constructing new apartments and special-needs housing are viewed as strong. Selling prices of new single-family homes were up slightly during the past six months, and rents increased in the low to mid-single digits. The volatility seen in building material prices over the past five months is beginning to subside, although there is still upward pressure on lumber prices. In the eastern third of the District, existing home sales (number of units, average sales price, and volume) showed a modest to moderate increase year-to-date relative to the same period in 2011. Similar results were seen in the southwest region of the District.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|8|Retailers reported slightly higher sales figures for July relative to results seen in June. However, several reports indicated that consumers, including those in higher-income brackets, are becoming more cautious when buying and are looking for value. One executive commented that retailers are pushing back orders for the upcoming holiday season. Retailers anticipate modest growth at best through the end of the third quarter. Vendor prices were fairly stable, and little change was noted in store prices. There is growing concern about the rise in agricultural commodity prices and the resulting impact on the cost of food products. Inventories continued to rise modestly, but they were described as manageable. Capital spending for the year remains on target, with little change anticipated during the next 12 months. Outlays are mainly for new store construction and technology upgrades. No hiring is expected, other than at new stores, and wage pressures are contained.
cleveland|Banking|2012|8|Bankers reported a modest increase in the demand for business credit, mainly for refinancings and acquisitions. A few contacts cited rising demand for industrial loans and financing multifamily housing developments. Little change in consumer credit was observed. Auto lending remains the bright spot on the consumer side, although a few bankers observed some softening since our last report. In the residential mortgage market, demand was described as stable to very strong, with a high percentage of applicants looking to refinance. Several bankers expressed concern about the low interest rate environment and compliance costs related to new regulations and their effect on profitability. We heard a few reports about a moderate loosening of lending guidelines. Delinquencies were steady or improved. Core deposits rose. Bankers project little change in payrolls for the remainder of this year.
cleveland|Energy|2012|8|Conventional oil and natural gas production increased since our last report, with higher production expected to continue in the upcoming months. Some of the increase was attributed to rising demand from electric utilities. Low wellhead prices for natural gas were cited as a reason for a decline in drilling conventional wells. Additional drilling rigs are being moved to Ohio from Pennsylvania to take advantage of the higher-priced wet gas found in the Utica shale. Coal production this year is expected to fall below 2011 levels due to reduced demand for thermal coal from domestic utilities and slowing markets for metallurgical coal in Europe and Asia. Spot prices for steam coal have increased slightly, while prices for export metallurgical coal declined further. Production equipment and materials prices were flat in most categories, and capital outlays remain at projected levels. Moderate layoffs were announced by several coal producers, and conventional oil and gas companies have trimmed back their payrolls.
cleveland|Transportation|2012|8|Most reports on freight volume indicated that the slowdown which began mid way through the second quarter has stabilized or started to turn around. The outlook for the remainder of 2012 remains positive, but growth is not expected to be as strong as had been forecasted at the beginning of the year. Apart from fluctuating diesel prices, costs associated with truck maintenance held steady. Some carriers are maintaining their fuel surcharges and successfully negotiated rate increases when contracts came up for renewal. Capital spending for 2012 remained on plan. Outlays are allocated for the replacement of aging units and adding capacity. A few executives reported that rising prices for new trucks combined with difficulty in obtaining credit is limiting growth opportunities, especially for small carriers. Driver recruitment remains difficult, resulting in some wage pressure.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|8|Most contacts in the retail sector reported generally slower sales. Contacts in the restaurant industry in particular were less positive in July. Discount retail operations performed somewhat better than traditional department stores, while luxury goods merchants remained largely positive, although their reports were more mixed than earlier in the year. Sales expectations for most retailers remained conservative. Auto sales continued to grow at a solid pace and dealers anticipated continued strong results.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|8|District residential brokers reported that sales were up slightly compared with year-ago levels. Brokers continued to note declining inventories, which has put some upward pressure on home prices in many markets. Contacts indicated that buying interest continued to improve from earlier in the year. The outlook for home sales over the next several months remained positive, with the majority of contacts anticipating modest gains.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|8|Manufacturing contacts noted a contraction in new orders and production levels since the last report. Roughly one quarter of manufacturing contacts still expect production to improve from current levels over the next three-to-six months, but an equal number anticipate additional declines. Half see output levels near current readings. Despite falling non-labor input costs, a slump in new orders is keeping margins thin. Construction-related manufacturing firms cited a bit more optimism since the last report, crediting recent improvements in several housing market indicators.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|8|Banking contacts continued to note margin and profit pressures. Competition among banks and credit unions for high-quality loans remained intense, further driving down margins. A few bankers cited positive loan growth, but overall loan demand remained low. Some contacts noted pockets of improvement in residential real estate lending, driven mostly by refinancing. Contacts also reported robust auto lending. Community banks looked to fee-related services in an effort to become less dependent on the pricing spread between loans and deposits. Some contacts cited increased consumer credit card use.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2012|8|Regional employment growth remained very tepid. Few firms reported their intention to add to current staffing levels, but there were only scattered reports of firms planning layoffs. Companies that rely on contracts with the Department of Defense were not yet cutting back on staff or otherwise changing their business plans because the timing and focus of defense spending cutbacks is highly uncertain. Many firms continued to note increased hiring of temporary or contract workers. Several companies have also reported large capital investments which reduced the need for labor. Meanwhile, contacts also continued to note difficulty filling highly skilled positions. Several firms continued to report that weak demand and uncertainty surrounding fiscal and regulatory policy weighed on decision-making processes.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|8|Contacts reported a renewed increase in production at Gulf Coast refineries because of recent closures along the East Coast. An increase in demand for crude oil and oil products, along with the Gulf Coast seeing particularly high demand for diesel fuels and other distillates, has helped to support refined product prices.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|8|Retailers report that sales activity has firmed somewhat since the last report. Two major retail chains report that sales in the region were on plan in July and ahead of plan in early August. Similarly a major retail mall in upstate New York reports some firming in sales, as well as shopper traffic, in July and early August, following lackluster business in May and June. Retail prices continue to be described as steady--including apparel prices, which had previously been expected to drift down with the retreat in cotton prices earlier this year. Stores in New York City have performed on par or modestly better than those in the rest of the region. Inventories are generally said to be at or slightly above desired levels.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|8|Housing markets across the District have shown further signs of modest improvement since the last report. The housing market in the Buffalo area continued to show strength through mid-July, though activity has dropped off in recent weeks--to a greater extent than the seasonal norm. Northern New Jersey's housing market has bottomed and is showing scattered signs of improvement, according to an industry expert. This contact also maintains that internal market fundamentals are favorable: low and declining inventories, pent up demand, high affordability and a steady reduction in the foreclosure pipeline Manhattan's co-op and condo market has been fairly active since mid-year, relative to the normal seasonal pattern of slowing. In particular, there has been strong activity at the very high end (for "trophy properties") and also for entry-level apartments, driven in part by low mortgage rates. There has been more significant improvement reported in Brooklyn and especially in Queens, where an inventory glut has evaporated surprisingly quickly, according to one contact. New York City apartment rents have continued to rise across all segments, and Albany's rental market has strengthened noticeably, with rents running 7 percent higher than a year ago.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|8|Businesses across the District indicate some softening in general conditions since the last report. A rising number of contacts in both manufacturing and other sectors indicate a recent pullback in business activity. While some pickup in input price pressures has been noted in recent weeks and further increases are anticipated in the months ahead, most report steady selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|8|Small- to medium-sized banks in the District report a noticeable pickup in overall loan demand. Particularly widespread increases in demand were reported for both residential and commercial mortgage loans, while demand for consumer loans was little changed. As was the case in the last report, demand for commercial & industrial loans decreased. Bankers also indicate steady demand for refinancing. Virtually all contacts report no change in credit standards across all loan categories. Respondents indicate continued decreases in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly commercial & industrial loans and commercial mortgages. Respondents also note continued declines in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers report declining delinquency rates, particularly on commercial & industrial loans and residential mortgages.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|8|The pace of growth in consumer spending increased slightly in July and early August due in large part to heavy discounting by retailers to clear inventory space for back-to-school items. Store traffic was similar to last year at this time; however, retail contacts noted that the recent increases in gas prices were leading to less discretionary spending. Sales of summer clothing and other seasonal items remained strong. Sales of big-ticket items such as furniture again were weak, although sales of electronics improved some. Auto sales were little changed from the prior reporting period and dealers reported that inventories were beginning to creep up.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|8|Growth in business spending slowed from the prior reporting period. Inventories were generally reported to be at comfortable levels. However, retailers remained cautious in their back-to-school and holiday season ordering and manufacturers also expressed a desire to tightly manage their inventories. Capital expenditures on software and equipment were proceeding as planned, but contacts cited a greater degree of restraint in new spending projects. Labor market conditions were little changed on balance. Hiring remained selective in most industries, with demand comparatively stronger for skilled manufacturing and construction workers, information technology specialists, and engineers. Several manufacturers reported transitioning temporary employees into permanent positions, and a staffing firm reported an increase in demand from the manufacturing sector.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2012|8|Construction activity continued to increase at a slow but steady pace in July and early August. Multi-family construction remained an area of strength, and residential single-family construction increased slightly. Homebuilders noted that credit was still tight for residential projects, with lenders continuing to require large equity commitments before extending financing. Demand for nonresidential construction also continued to gradually increase. Industrial building and highway projects rose further. Elevated office and retail vacancy rates remained a drag on new commercial construction, but contacts indicated that demand for office space was slowly improving. That said, a commercial real estate broker noted that companies lack the confidence to make long-term real estate commitments, as many continue to negotiate for contracts with opt-out provisions after two to three years into their lease agreements.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|8|Growth in manufacturing production slowed further over the course of July and early August, with contacts expecting this slower rate of growth to persist throughout the second half of the year. In the steel industry, capacity utilization fluctuated some during the reporting period, but was roughly unchanged on balance. Metals manufacturers noted continued volatility in their customers' orders, as many were closely monitoring their inventory levels. The auto industry continued to be a source of strength for manufacturing. Demand for heavy equipment also remained solid, with rental fleets continuing to expand. Manufacturers of household goods and building materials reported that activity had picked up some, although it remained at low levels. The coal mining industry, however, was a notable exception, as the low price of natural gas has resulted in the substitution of natural gas for coal in electricity production. Exporters noted weaker demand from Europe and Asia, but continued strength from other parts of the world like Mexico.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|8|Credit conditions gradually improved over the reporting period. Credit spreads and volatility moved lower and increased competition led to downward pricing pressure on small business loans. Business loan demand continued to be mostly from small and middle market firms and for the purpose of refinancing existing debt as opposed to financing capital expenditures. Banking contacts reported that many of their customers are waiting to assess the impact of the upcoming election on tax and healthcare policies. Consumer loan demand was steady. Mortgage refinancing continued to increase and contacts noted the greater availability of sub-prime loans for used autos. With overall loan growth flattening out in recent months, a banking industry contact noted that some banks are investing in municipal bonds as a way to increase their earnings.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|8|Cost pressures were mixed in July and early August. Prices fell for a number of commodities but rose for materials like steel and lumber. Gasoline prices moved higher and shipping costs were also noted to have risen. Retailers reported that the spike in agricultural commodity prices resulting from the drought, particularly its impact on higher feed costs, was already starting to be passed through to wholesale prices. Wage pressures continued to be moderate, although several contacts cited upward pressure on healthcare costs.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|8|The drought has substantially reduced expected yields for corn and soybeans, although the impact varied considerably across the District. Scattered rains near the end of the reporting period helped revive soybeans to some degree; however, with the exception of some late-plantings, the precipitation was too late to improve yields for most of the corn crop. Crop insurance and higher prices will partially offset lost revenue. However, some farmers face the prospect of having to buy corn at market prices after selling ahead more than they will likely harvest. Livestock pastures are in poor shape as well, and fields with low corn yields were being chopped for silage to feed livestock. With feed costs high, livestock operations cannot cover their costs of production, and operators have reduced their herds accordingly. Hog and cattle prices were down from the prior reporting period, while dairy prices were up as milk production dipped.
dallas|Prices|2012|8|Most contacts said prices held steady, although some construction-related and vehicle manufacturers noted slight increases, and accounting and staffing firms reported a modest rise in billing rates. Paper product manufacturers and shipping firms noted plans to implement price increases in the near term. Overall, input costs were flat to up during the reporting period.  for scrap metal, steel and grains rose. Contacts reported that the rising cost of labor and land prices have increased builders' costs, and some were raising prices on new homes.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|8|Employment levels edged up or held steady at most responding firms. Staffing firms reported demand softened slightly from high levels and noted rising demand for mortgage refinance specialists, sales professionals and plastic product manufacturing workers. Reports of slight employment increases came from some automobile dealers, construction-related products manufacturers, transportation equipment producers and transportation service firms. A few respondents noted difficulty filling vacant positions because of employment opportunities available in the energy sector, and contacts reported delays in housing starts because of labor shortages. Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure was reported for construction workers, truck drivers and accountants.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|8|Overall demand for construction-related products held steady or edged up since the last report, but outlooks were cautious. A cement producer noted that increased residential construction activity, particularly in South Texas, had improved demand. Fabricated metals producers noted an uptick in orders, largely stemming from both public infrastructure projects and private construction activity such as high rise residential buildings and warehouse facilities. Demand for primary metals was steady over the past six weeks, and expectations were for business to remain flat through year-end.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|8|Retail sales grew slightly over the reporting period and were up from a year ago. Particular strength was seen in sales of accessories, cosmetics and women's and children's apparel. Sales growth in the Eleventh District remained stronger than the nation, on average, according to two large retailers. Retailers expect a seasonal pickup in demand in the fourth quarter, although sales will likely be down from last year.
dallas|Services|2012|8|Staffing firms said demand slowed slightly over the past six weeks. Still, activity remained at high levels and business was stronger compared with last year. Outlooks remained positive, yet there was concern among contacts about uncertainty stemming from the upcoming presidential election. Accounting firms noted continued seasonal weakness in overall demand but said activity related to the energy industry remained a bright spot, and outlooks for energy-focused areas were particularly upbeat. Legal firms reported a continued pickup in demand, with sustained strength in intellectual property litigation, energy and real estate-related services.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|8|Housing activity remained strong since the last report. Contacts said sales of new and existing homes continued at a good pace and were well above expectations. Builders noted strong traffic and reported rising backlogs, while realtors said shrinking inventories had led to price gains. Apartment demand remained strong, and contacts noted rising construction activity as investors continue to be attracted to the market. Housing outlooks remain positive.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|8|Overall, loan demand softened somewhat during the reporting period. Corporate lending activity remained weak, while residential real estate loan demand rose strongly. Loan pricing remained competitive and deposits continued to grow. The quality of outstanding loans continued to improve slowly as nonperforming loans declined. Outlooks were positive, but contacts expressed concern about European debt issues, new regulations for community banks and the upcoming national elections.
dallas|Energy|2012|8|Respondents at energy-related firms said overall activity remained at high levels, with long lead times and growing backlogs. Drilling activity continued to shift from dry natural gas to oil and natural gas liquids. While the shift has not affected overall activity levels, contacts expect a plateau in the growth of rig activity through year-end, in part due to recent weakness in the price of natural gas liquids. Oil-related activity continues to be strong, and contacts expect continued improvement in offshore drilling.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|8|Drought conditions improved slightly due to scattered rainfall in July. Crops remained mostly in fair to good shape, with the exception of dryland cotton crop in the Texas High Plains region which suffered due to lack of moisture. Overall, crop conditions were much better than a year ago. Drought in the Midwest has caused grain prices to climb sharply, squeezing margins for ranchers by driving up feed costs for livestock.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2012|8|Contacts reported that retail sales in July and early August were up slightly, on average, over year-earlier levels. About 42 percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 33 percent saw decreases and 25 percent saw no changes. Half of the retailers noted that sales levels met their expectations and half noted that sales were below expectations. About 13 percent of the retailers noted that their inventories were too high, while 8 percent reported that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook through the fall was generally optimistic: 70 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, 17 percent expect sales to decrease, and 13 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's sales.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|8|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been mixed since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to expand operations and hire new workers, while fewer manufacturers reported plans to lay off workers. However, the reported plans for layoffs usually involved a greater number of workers relative to the reported hiring plans. Firms in automobile, medical technology products, carbon and graphite products, air purification equipment, electrical equipment, automobile parts, metal can, nanotechnology, lifting equipment, and industrial machinery manufacturing reported plans to expand operations and hire new workers. In contrast, firms in air transportation, chemical, appliance, wind turbine, and aluminum manufacturing reported plans to lay off workers and close plants.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|8|Home sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, June 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 13 percent in Louisville, 7 percent in Little Rock, 10 percent in Memphis, and 16 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District. June 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits increased 42 percent in Louisville, 14 percent in Little Rock, 46 percent in Memphis, and 23 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|8|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks indicated moderate changes in overall lending activity in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the first quarter of 2012. During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans remained largely unchanged, while demand for such loans increased moderately. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans remained generally unchanged, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to moderately stronger. Credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans also remained generally unchanged, while demand ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Credit standards for consumer loans ranged from basically unchanged to somewhat eased, while demand was moderately stronger, especially for auto loans.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|8|Severe drought conditions have caused downgrades to forecasted crop production. Annual 2012 production of cotton, soybean, and corn in the District states is expected to fall from 2011 levels by 12 percent, 18 percent, and 24 percent, respectively. In contrast, annual production of rice and sorghum in the District states is expected to increase by at least 12 percent. The fraction of all crops rated in fair or better condition has fallen in all District states since the previous report. Similarly, the fraction of pasture rated in fair or better condition declined in all District states. The District states' year-to-date coal production for the end of July was 3.4 percent higher compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile, the District states' coal production for July 2012 was approximately on par with July 2011.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|8|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have continued to report overall declines in shipments and new orders; however, the weak demand was less widespread. Makers of lumber and wood products; stone, clay, and glass products; and fabricated metal products have reported gains--some seasonal--since the last Beige Book. Lower activity was reported by makers of food products, primary metals, industrial machinery, electronic equipment, and instruments. Contacts report that many customers are delaying purchases due to uncertainty stemming from the European crisis and domestic fiscal policy.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|8|Third District retailers reported a pickup in year-over-year sales for July compared with June. In early August, a retail outlet operator reported stronger sales but softer traffic counts. One contact noted that Olympic viewership numbers were very strong and may have dampened traffic. Another contact relayed the theory that the pervasive negative political advertising will dampen sales until after the election by displacing product ads and by creating a negative sales climate. According to some contacts, children's clothing is typically the last retail category to experience declining sales in a downturn. Sales of children's clothing did not improve in July after a surprising year-over-year decline in June. Despite these various headwinds, retail contacts remain cautiously optimistic.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|8|Contacts from the Third District's financial sector have reported ongoing growth since the previous Beige Book. Larger lenders reported loan growth in mortgages, personal loans, small business loans, and C&I loans. Smaller lenders continue to report increases primarily as gains in market share in various lending segments from other banks--large and small. Several small lenders reported increased activity in mortgages and home refinancings. Most contacts report that the financial health of households, businesses, and financial institutions continues to improve. Although the overall outlook among lenders was positive, there is an expectation of tempered growth until after the election, and there are concerns about the impacts of the fiscal decisions that will follow.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|8|Residential builders reported a modest increase in sales and a stronger increase in traffic--an improvement since the last Beige Book--as they near the end of their primary sales season. Large builders are shifting their portfolios toward more multifamily products and more urban locations. Some small builders are shifting into home renovation work. Residential brokers reported continued improvement in the sales of existing homes through July. Inventory levels are also falling. As the traditional sales season draws to a close, an anticipated surge of listings from the shadow inventory is not expected until spring 2013, assuming existing home sales remain relatively strong. Builders and brokers share a cautiously optimistic outlook.
philadelphia|Services|2012|8|Third District service-sector firms have reported little to no growth since the last Beige Book. Several contacts reported that orders and activity have flattened out. Logistics firms and carriers reported a relatively flat start to the traditional "freight season," which should have ramped up in June. One contact reported that reduced crop yields from widespread drought-stricken areas have generated an excess supply of drivers and trucks, which may have siphoned normal business from other firms. Staffing firms report no net new orders. One large firm that had been extending temp contracts has begun letting them expire. Hospitals report some growth, which may reflect demand for elective procedures that were deferred during the recession. Additional growth may reflect expansions that garner greater market share. Advertising is a rare bright spot. Revenue from the Olympics and election-year advertising has surpassed expectations, on top of a positive underlying trend. Overall, service-sector firms' positive outlook for growth over the next six months has been somewhat tempered.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|8|Price levels changed little overall, although gas prices have risen a little since the previous Beige Book. Cost factors have risen slightly among manufacturing firms since the last Beige Book. One manufacturer reported that the drought and heat conditions have contributed to relatively lower diesel prices and to higher peak energy prices, respectively. Homebuilders and retailers continue to report tight margins but little additional escalation of the prices that they face. Contacts from all sectors report little or no wage pressures, other than for medical benefits. Many contacts report stabilized house prices for lower-cost homes. Now, some contacts report that the prices of homes in a few affluent areas are beginning to stabilize as well.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|8|Most Districts reported that retail spending in July and early August was up compared with the previous Beige Book. New York and San Francisco noted strengthening sales compared with a softer May and June, although in San Francisco's case, the rise was only "a bit further." Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported stronger retail sales, while Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas all said that sales were up "slightly." In the Atlanta District, most retail contacts reported slower sales, while Boston's retail contacts provided a mixed assessment. The Atlanta and San Francisco reports noted that discount retailers performed better than traditional department stores, while the Chicago report attributed the pace of growth in consumer spending to heavy discounting by retailers clearing space for back-to-school items. Boston and Chicago reported continuing weakness in furniture sales; Boston also reported weak sales of electronics, but Chicago noted some improvement in this category. Adult clothing sold well in Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. The Atlanta District said that luxury goods merchants, while still largely positive, provided more mixed reports compared with earlier this year; Kansas City cited weaker sales for high-end jewelry. For the remainder of 2012, Boston retailers have mixed sales expectations, Philadelphia retailers are cautiously optimistic, and those in Atlanta are conservative; retail contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas expect sales to rise through the end of the year.
summary|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|8|The picture in manufacturing was mixed. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported increasing demand and sales since the previous Beige Book, although the improvement was generally small and uneven, with two of these four Districts reporting that demand growth, while positive, was slowing. Six Districts reported that demand for manufactured goods was actually falling, although none reported a dramatic fall. The outlook was somewhat more positive, with six Districts reporting that manufacturers expected increasing demand and only two reporting the opposite.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2012|8|Activity in nonfinancial services generally picked up since the previous report, although results were mixed across Districts and service industries. New York and Philadelphia reported that overall service-sector activity was flat to down slightly, whereas Minneapolis and San Francisco noted expanding activity. Several Districts, including Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco, reported steady to increasing demand for information technology services; Kansas City, by contrast, cited decreased sales at high-tech services firms. Reports from the healthcare sector were also somewhat mixed, with Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting positive results and San Francisco noting a drop in the frequency of elective procedures. Advertisers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts continued to report strong revenues. In the Dallas District, legal firms reported continued increases in demand for services, while accounting firms cited seasonal slowness. Demand for staffing services was generally lower than expected, with decreases reported by Boston, New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Even so, demand remained strong for highly skilled IT personnel in the Boston and Richmond Districts.
summary|Banking and Financial Services|2012|8|Credit conditions have improved over the reporting period according to District reports. Credit spreads were lower and competition for high-quality borrowers among lending institutions has increased. The New York District noted that shrinking spreads were observed particularly in commercial and industrial loans as well as in commercial mortgages. Some bankers in the Cleveland District mentioned a moderate loosening of lending guidelines. The New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts reported unchanged credit standards; New York and Cleveland cited declining delinquency rates.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|8|Housing markets across most Districts exhibited signs of improvement, with sales and construction continuing to increase. Dallas reported significant levels of buyer traffic, Richmond noted strong pending sales, and Minneapolis and St. Louis mentioned increases in building permits. New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago indicated improvements as well, but characterized the progress as slow and modest. Declines in inventory levels were reported in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco; these declining inventories put some upward pressure on prices according to Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas. A reduction in the stock of distressed properties was mentioned in New York, Richmond, and San Francisco. In Philadelphia and Kansas City, the possibility of shadow inventory entering the market remains a concern. In general, outlooks were positive, with continued increases in activity expected, although the projected gains were more modest in Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|8|According to District reports, agricultural conditions were mixed largely because of severe drought conditions that affected the Midwest more than the rest of the country. Producers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts were all severely affected by the drought, with cotton, soybean, and corn crops particularly damaged. Cotton production in the Dallas District was also badly damaged, while the northern part of the Minneapolis District reported good corn, soybean, and wheat crops, and the San Francisco and Richmond Districts reported strong demand for their healthy cotton crops. Although nearly all agricultural commodity prices rose, higher feed costs led to reduced herd sizes and lower livestock prices in nearly all Districts reporting on livestock. Reports from the Richmond and Kansas City Districts indicated that farmland values have continued to rise, although contacts in the Kansas City District expected them to hold steady for the rest of the year. Farm incomes generally rose or stayed the same in the Minneapolis District.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|8|Most Districts reported that employment was holding steady or growing only slightly. Several Districts including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond noted a softening in employment relative to expectations; upcoming layoffs were reported by a defense contractor in the Boston District and by firms in sectors such as air transportation, appliances, and business support services in the St Louis District. Almost all Districts indicated that manufacturers were continuing to hire, albeit modestly. Demand has been strongest for skilled manufacturing and engineering positions, as well as for IT services. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts all reported some difficulty meeting demand for truck drivers.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|8|District manufacturing activity continued to decline since our last report. A manufacturer reported that demand fell sharply for heating equipment components, with domestic and European customers both reducing their orders. An auto supplier also reported a significant drop in new orders in the past two months. Another auto parts manufacturer stated that earlier in the year, demand for his components was growing, but now orders were "treading water." He added that inventories were rising and he expected to cut production. A food manufacturer reported that power outages from recent storms resulted in a one-week shutdown, and production did not return to normal for over three weeks. According to our latest manufacturing survey, growth in raw materials prices slowed over the past month, while finished goods prices edged downward.
richmond|Retail|2012|8|ers reported improved sales since our last report. Merchants in several states had a successful "tax free weekend" in early August. In addition, some department store contacts said they were able to clear inventories of patio furniture and other seasonal items. Several jewelry retailers also reported increased sales. Record heat this summer helped to push air conditioner sales, with one big-box store depleting its entire inventory. An auto industry contact reported that District sales grew at a somewhat slower pace in recent weeks, although demand remained especially strong for mid-size vehicles. Used cars remained in short supply, putting upward pressure on prices and improving trade-in values. A number of apparel and furniture contacts noted that inventories for the upcoming holiday shopping season will be kept tight, since they expect to be able to easily reorder as needed. Grocery executives expected price increases in meat and dairy products, due to rising feed costs caused by drought. The pace of retail price change rose moderately, according to our most recent survey.
richmond|Services|2012|8|Accounts from non-retail services firms were generally positive in recent weeks. An executive at a North Carolina healthcare system reported that demand for services had been steady, adding that there were a few "sparks" from the arrival of new businesses in an otherwise stagnant local economy. Contacts at healthcare organizations expressed concern about potential Medicare reimbursement cuts that will come with the change to value-based metrics under the new healthcare legislation. Ground freight firms reported solid demand and higher shipping rates. A freight service executive reported that retailers increasingly have moved to an online presence in addition to in-store sales, contributing to growth in direct shipping to customers through internet sales. Technology services continued to be in strong demand, particularly for developing websites, mobile services, and cloud computing. On balance, responses to our recent survey were that price increases at services firms moderated since our last report.
richmond|Finance|2012|8|Banking activity was little changed from the weak, but somewhat mixed conditions that prevailed in our last report. Most bankers said that very few new loans were made recently and the number of loans in the pipeline was shrinking. An often-cited exception was mortgage refinancing, as well as business loans that were captured from other banks by offers of better terms. However, several mortgage lenders noted some increase in new home loans, especially in the mid-priced range, and one official reported a modest increase in single-home construction loans. A Maryland banker cited a sharp increase in small business loans, but several other bankers stated that many small business loan applications did not meet lending standards. A lending officer in northern Virginia reported a slowdown in industrial loans due to rising economic uncertainty. A banker in West Virginia noted strength in industrial loans going into the state's energy sector, although he expected lending to decline after the completion of current mining projects. While margins continued to be squeezed, most bankers described loan quality as stable following several quarters of steady improvement.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|8|Residential real estate activity continued to improve since our last report. A Realtor in the Richmond area said that sales were up double digits over last year and pending sales had increased sharply from a year ago. Moreover, his company had seen a marked increase in prices. An agent in the D.C. area also reported strong sales "inside the Beltway." A Realtor in the Fredericksburg area indicated that sales had increased and traffic was very active for this time of year, noting that the average sales price had risen by about $40,000 over last year. She mentioned that her firm had seen virtually no listings of foreclosed properties in July, and she saw fewer short sales. A West Virginia developer, who specializes in second homes in the mountains, stated that there had been an increase in inquiries and contracts for homes after four years without any sales. Similarly, a contractor reported a solid increase in home sales in the Charleston, South Carolina area, with the average price of new homes sold rising slightly as well.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|8|Labor market activity weakened since our last report. Contacts at several employment agencies described demand for workers as softening in the past six weeks. In Richmond, several small retailers said that they did not hire summer workers and they were not planning additional hiring for the year-end holiday selling season.  One agent noted that demand was slightly below normal for this time of year, but he hoped to see a rebound similar to the one that occurred late last summer. However, a few pockets of strength persisted. For example, most employment agencies continued to report strong demand for highly skilled IT employees, as jobs created by new technologies drove the market for those workers. Additionally, several contacts noted an increase in demand for truck drivers. According to our recent surveys, wages in both the manufacturing and service sectors were growing at a slightly slower pace than a month ago.
richmond|Tourism|2012|8|District resorts reported a very good summer season, with rentals and hotel bookings up from a year ago. Local restaurants and shops have been busy, and a contact on the Outer Banks of North Carolina said that new businesses were opening to serve vacationers. Cruise ships leaving the Port of Baltimore have been fully booked, according to a contact there. In Washington, D.C., a contact observed more tour buses in recent weeks and bigger weekend crowds on the National Mall. However, according to a couple of Baltimore hotel managers, bookings for conferences and leisure stays were mixed. Additionally, a hotel contact in the Virginia Beach area said that bookings were making "no great strides," primarily as a result of government travel cuts. Despite the lack of momentum in government travel, most hoteliers said that they were able to raise rates slightly. Looking ahead to late autumn, executives were optimistic about bookings, as localities planned historical commemorations, music programs, food festivals, marathons, and other social events. In South Carolina, a hotel manager anticipated that a new carrier at a nearby airport would provide solid bookings in the months ahead.
richmond|Agriculture|2012|8|Widespread precipitation since our last report helped revitalize crops and pastureland in many areas of the District. Rain in early August aided late summer peaches in Maryland and West Virginia, and soybeans were responding to improved weather conditions in Virginia. Cotton and peanut growers in the District are also having a great year. In South Carolina, the cantaloupe and watermelon harvest was virtually complete by early August. Results of our recent agricultural credit survey indicated that farmland values were above both the previous quarter and year-ago levels.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|8|Consumer spending continued to increase in July and early August and was expected to rise further over the next three months. Retailers reported higher sales, though gains were a bit less than expected. Home furnishings, clothing and back-to-school items sold well, while sales of high-end jewelry were weaker. Auto sales increased sharply as more incentives were offered and access to credit improved slightly. Demand for small and mid-sized crossovers, SUVs and cars was strong, while demand for larger SUVs and minivans remained weak. Most auto dealers expected sales to strengthen further in the months ahead. Restaurant sales increased, and several contacts expected higher menu prices in coming months in response to rising food costs. After strong gains in June, hotel occupancy fell slightly in July and early August, but average room rates continued to rise. In terms of tourism, the number of visitors at local attractions grew slightly, and modest gains were expected in the months ahead.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|8|Transportation activity continued to grow moderately, manufacturing activity expanded slightly, and sales at high-tech services firms declined slightly. Transportation activity continued to rise, with an increase in sales and backlog activity. Input prices and prices charged for transportation services increased with higher fuel costs. Capital spending plans at transportation firms remained largely unchanged, with firms continuing to expect a modest increase in capital spending in coming months. Manufacturing production and hiring rose modestly, though the volume of new orders, volume of shipments, and backlogs declined since the last survey. Manufacturers expected activity to expand in coming months. Sales at high-tech services firms decreased slightly, and capital spending grew modestly. High-tech contacts expected improved sales in the months ahead and a strong rise in capital spending.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|8|Residential and commercial real estate activity continued to improve in July and early August, and construction activity strengthened. Residential home sales and prices rose, and home inventories fell. Contacts reported multiple offers on homes and expected continued housing market improvements in coming months. Homes under $300,000 sold particularly well, while homes priced over $500,000 and condos were slow to sell in some markets. Several contacts reported that a large inventory of homes in foreclosure has been held back and could put downward pressure on prices when the homes come onto the market. Builders reported an increase in housing starts and a rise in new home prices as well as improvement in the traffic of potential buyers. Land prices and the cost of building materials rose during the survey period as demand improved. Commercial real estate conditions also improved. Construction and sales of commercial real estate properties rose, real estate prices and rents increased, and vacancy rates continued to fall. Several commercial real estate contacts expected uncertainty surrounding the presidential election to slow activity until late in the year. Developers reported that access to credit remained unchanged.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|8|In the recent survey period, bankers generally reported slightly stronger loan demand, improving loan quality, and little change in deposits. Overall loan demand improved slightly as most respondents reported stable loan demand for commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer installment loans, while demand for residential real estate loans improved. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and the majority of respondents reported stable deposits. The majority of bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and nearly all banks expected loan quality over the next six months to remain steady or improve.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|8|Agricultural conditions deteriorated as crops withered under extreme drought. The majority of the corn and soybean crops were rated in fair or poor condition, cutting production estimates and sending crop prices to record highs. Drought strained profit margins for livestock producers as feed costs rose and further herd liquidations dampened cattle prices. Escalating production costs were expected to boost farm loan demand in the coming months. Agricultural bankers indicated ample funds were available for farm loans at historically low interest rates. Loan repayment rates were expected to hold near year-ago levels due in large part to crop insurance and higher land lease revenues for mineral rights. While still well above year-ago levels, farmland values rose less rapidly and were expected to hold steady during the rest of the growing season.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|8|District energy activity remained fairly stable at high levels in July and early August. Drilling activity rose as growth in the number of active crude oil rigs offset declines in natural gas drilling. Most contacts expected drilling activity to slow in coming months due to local and national regulatory obstacles and low natural gas prices. Stable demand growth and ample supply of crude oil were expected to limit further increases in crude oil prices in coming months. Contacts expected the slowdown in natural gas drilling to put upward pressure on natural gas prices over the next three months. Shortages were reported for equipment and labor, particularly for oil and natural gas operators and drilling engineers. Several contacts also reported that the drought has affected drilling operations by limiting water availability needed for hydraulic fracturing.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|8|Finished goods prices remained stable despite an increase in raw material prices, and wage pressures remained low. Manufacturers reported higher raw material prices, and finished goods prices remained flat. However, both raw material prices and finished goods prices were expected to increase over the next six months in the manufacturing sector, especially for food manufacturers. Retail prices increased slightly, and additional price increases were expected to remain modest. Restaurant menu prices remained flat, but many contacts expected to raise prices in the months ahead in response to higher food costs. Builders and construction supply firms also reported higher prices, especially for roofing materials, lumber and concrete. Wage pressures remained subdued, and only a few contacts expected to raise wages more than normal to attract or retain workers. However, many firms continued to report some difficulty filling skilled positions including drivers, technicians, engineers, computer programmers, and sales representatives.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|10|Price inflation remained quite limited for most final goods and services during the reporting period. Prices increased overall for some energy items including electricity, crude oil, and retail gasoline. Natural gas prices remained near historically low levels. Contacts noted high feed prices are passing through to grocery stores and restaurants. Contacts in the tech sector reported slightly lower prices of some technology-related products. For most products and services, vigorous competition among firms and cost-conscious purchasing behavior by consumers continued to keep price inflation in check.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|10|Retail sales rose further overall. Contacts reported sales were a bit stronger relative to the prior reporting period. Discount chains and online retailers continued to outperform traditional department stores. At grocery stores, consumer spending was soft as shoppers continued to shift their purchasing decisions in favor of cheaper products. Contacts reported a strong pace for auto sales, significantly above the pace from the same period last year. Demand for used vehicles also remained robust.
san_francisco||2012|10|Demand for most business and consumer services gained on net. Sales continued to grow for a wide variety of technology services, with expectations for further rapid growth in selected segments, such as cloud computing services. Demand for legal services was steady. For providers of health-care services, demand was largely stable. Demand picked up further for restaurants and other food-service providers. Some contacts in the District's travel and tourism sector reported improvement in conditions overall.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|10|District manufacturing activity edged up on balance during the reporting period of mid-August through late-September. Production activity remained at high levels for makers of commercial aircraft and parts. Manufacturers of wood products reported stronger than expected output and sales. New orders improved somewhat for manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products. Demand for steel was mostly stable, albeit at low levels, while sales of processed scrap metal fell further, largely as a result of sustained weak demand abroad. For petroleum refiners, capacity utilization rates increased to the highest levels in years, as growing export sales offset relatively weak domestic demand for refined petroleum products.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|10|Agricultural activity was mostly stable, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production continued to expand. Contacts noted continued efforts by agricultural businesses to increase their productivity. Reports indicated that demand for cotton was strong. Higher grain and feed prices prompted District livestock producers to reduce herd sizes. Favorable weather conditions in some parts of the District helped stabilize production. Extraction activity for petroleum and natural gas remained at high levels or expanded a bit further on net.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|10|Home demand in the District showed continued signs of improvement, while demand for commercial real estate was largely unchanged. Although still well below its historical average, the sales pace for new and existing homes picked up further in many areas. Contacts noted that pent-up demand may spur additional gains in coming months. Contacts reported a decrease in the inventory of available homes and a noticeable increase in construction activity. On the nonresidential side, contacts observed a reduction in commercial property vacancies in parts of the District.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|10|District banking contacts reported that loan demand was unchanged or up somewhat compared with the prior reporting period. Some contacts reported that business loan demand inched up, although some of the new activity was for refinancing rather than expansion. Reports continued to highlight ample liquidity and stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to well-qualified business loan applicants. Contacts indicated that some borrowers received multiple offers to finance projects. Demand for consumer credit remained relatively strong, reflected primarily in high lending activity for automobile and home purchases.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2012|10|First District retailers contacted for this round indicate that sales through mid to late September are slightly above 2011. Year-over-year sales increases in recent months range from low single-digit to high single-digit percentage gains, although one retailer reports that its 2012 sales to date are 2 percent to 3 percent below last year's. Furniture sales have picked up after declining during the summer, while spending on apparel and household items remains strong. Contacts express some concern that consumer sentiment could be negatively affected by domestic politics and the fiscal cliff, which increases their uncertainty about how well the end-of-year 2012 holiday sales season will turn out. While such concerns lead retailers to expect the U.S. economy will remain flat over the next 6 to 8 months, respondents are nonetheless cautiously optimistic that their 2012 revenues will end up slightly ahead of 2011 levels.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|10|Discussions with manufacturing contacts in the First District paint a picture of an economy that is growing slowly but, on net, still growing. About half the respondents report a substantial slowdown in growth or outright fall in sales in the most recent period compared with a year earlier. Three contacts supplying equipment to factories note weakness in the semiconductor industry, which they say reflects its idiosyncratic cycle and not the macro economy. A contact in the toy business reports that orders for Christmas are coming later and later in the year, partly because lead times have shrunk and firms can order in September for November delivery.
boston|Selected Business Services|2012|10|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report a generally positive, although not exuberant, third quarter. Only one contact cites flat revenues, while the others note varying levels of growth largely determined by the prospects of their respective client bases. Marketing and advertising contacts report weaker conditions than consulting firms. They note a large degree of uncertainty in the market as well as a shift in demand towards services focused on social media and e-commerce. Demand for health care consulting services has skyrocketed due to "unprecedented" levels of merger and acquisition activity among health care providers and the need for improved efficiency as a result of the ACA. At the same time, firms focused on the pharmaceutical industry have experienced slow growth because their clients have been hurt by blockbuster drugs losing patent protection and cost pressures from governments. Economic consulting remains strong, reflecting high levels of complex high-stakes litigation; management and strategy consulting contacts cite a recent upswing in business.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|10|Contacts across the First District report that commercial real estate fundamentals have been basically flat in recent weeks. Leasing activity is said to be down in Boston as firms say political uncertainty makes them reluctant to make leasing commitments in advance of the national election. At the same time, the credit environment remains favorable, as interest rates on commercial real estate loans remain very low by historical standards. One contact notes that the supply of high-quality commercial properties for sale has declined recently, and hypothesizes that owners have nowhere better to park their money right now. Construction activity is proceeding as expected on large commercial projects in Boston. While the multifamily sector remains strong across the region, with numerous apartment buildings under construction in Boston in particular, one contact surmises that additional apartment projects under discussion may be delayed or shelved pending rent discovery once current projects come on line.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|10|Year-over-year sales growth continued in August in both single-family home and condominium markets throughout the First District. According to contacts, low interest rates and affordable prices contributed to improving sales figures, along with increases in residential rents. Several contacts report improving conditions for borrowers, but many contacts say that qualifying for a mortgage remains difficult. As for prices, contacts in the region report mixed movements in median sale prices, with some areas experiencing modest price appreciation and others moderate depreciation. In the Greater Boston area, contacts say a slight decline in the median sale price was unexpected in light of significant demand and dwindling inventory levels; they attribute the decline to significant increases in the sales of low to mid-tier properties. Throughout the region, inventory continues to decline. Contacts say they fear declining inventory will discourage buyers searching for homes as well as potential sellers who may not be able to find another well-kept property. Increasingly, properties in "move-in condition" receive multiple bids, sometimes above original asking prices.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|10|Consumer spending increased moderately. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased 4 percent in August compared with a year ago. A Minneapolis area mall manger reported that sales over the past two months were up about 4 percent compared with a year earlier, while another Minneapolis mall reported that while traffic was flat, sales were up somewhat. In North Dakota, a mall manager reported that sales in August and September were up more than 5 percent from last year. Recent sales increased at a Minnesota-based women's apparel store. A domestic auto dealer reported strong sales activity near the end of September and solid commercial fleet sales. A representative of an auto dealers association in North Dakota reported strong vehicle sales across the state.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|10|Commercial construction activity increased since the last report. The value of commercial building permits issued in August more than quadrupled from the same period last year in both the Sioux Falls, S.D., and Billings, Mont., areas. A Minneapolis area construction contact noted interest in building a regional warehouse, while a research and development building was also planned. Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential building permits in the Sioux Falls area in August was up 11 percent from the same period last year. The number of residential permits more than doubled in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in August compared with a year ago. The value of residential permits issued in August more than doubled in Billings.
minneapolis|Services|2012|10|Activity at professional business services firms grew slightly since the last report. According to an architecture firm, demand for services picked up recently. An information technology consulting company noted a recent uptick in the number of projects. A data center opened in northern Minnesota. An environmental consulting firm noticed increased activity primarily due to oil and gas pipeline analysis. A logistics consulting firm noted that recent freight volumes are about the same as last year.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|10|The manufacturing sector weakened slightly since the last report. A survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity decreased in Minnesota and South Dakota in August for the second month in a row, though the rate of contraction was not as sharp as in July. Activity increased in North Dakota, but at a slower pace than the previous month. In contrast, an agricultural equipment maker announced that it will open operations in Minnesota, and a machining firm expanded operations in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2012|10|Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained strong. Oil and gas exploration decreased slightly in North Dakota and increased in Montana; however, North Dakota oil production hit a new record. A large railroad increased its capacity for carrying crude oil out of North Dakota's Williston Basin. Several large transmission-line projects were under way around the District. In contrast, another Minnesota ethanol plant shut down, and a North Dakota wind-turbine producer cut production, citing reductions in demand and uncertainty over the expiration of a federal tax credit. District iron ore mines continued operating at near capacity. Sand mines saw increased demand from oil and gas producers.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|10|was mixed, as crop farmers saw strong prices but widely varying yields, while animal producers saw tighter profit margins. Harvests were well ahead of schedule for crops around the region, thanks to hot and dry conditions late in the summer. District sugar beet producers were expecting a record harvest. The condition of the corn and soybean crops remained much better in Minnesota and North Dakota than in core corn belt states. However, portions of Wisconsin and South Dakota were hit much harder by drought. In addition, meat and dairy producers struggled with higher feed costs. Prices received by farmers increased for most agricultural outputs in September compared with a year earlier; the primary exceptions were milk and hogs, which saw price decreases.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|10|Labor markets tightened modestly. According to a survey by an employment services firm, 20 percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul expect to increase staffing levels during the fourth quarter, while 6 percent expect to decrease staff. A year ago, 12 percent anticipated increases, while 11 percent expected decreases. A recent Minnesota Chamber of Commerce survey showed that only 49 percent of companies responding said that the state has enough skilled workers in their respective industries. In Minnesota, a foreign information technology consulting firm plans to add 300 workers and a telecommunications company recently announced that it will add 150 call-center employees. In contrast, a North Dakota wind turbine manufacturer announced that it will lay off 300 workers. A hardboard plant in Minnesota closed, affecting 140 workers, and a medical devices company laid off 80 of its Minnesota workers as part of a reorganization plan.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|10|District factories reported that production levels were stable or increased during the past six weeks, while new orders weakened. Rising production was mainly limited to goods sold to the construction, energy, and transportation sectors. Compared to prior-year levels, output was higher for a majority of our contacts. Several producers pointed to a rise in inventories, but said that they are manageable. The outlook by manufacturers was mixed. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume was flat or down and they continued to reduce their inventory. A seasonal pickup that typically begins in September has yet to materialize. Several contacts noted that competition (volume and pricing) from offshore producers has intensified. Steel producers do not expect market conditions to change appreciably in the upcoming months. District auto production recovered in August on a month-over-month basis, as auto plants returned to normal production schedules. Compared to a year ago, production figures were down slightly for domestic producers, while showing a moderate rise for foreign nameplates. The latter is attributable to the abatement of supply chain issues.
cleveland|Real Estate|2012|10|Reports from home builders on single-family housing starts were mixed. Compared to a year ago, construction activity was described as similar. On balance, builders expect a modest rise in new-home construction in the near term. Spec building remains on the low side, due in part to difficulty in obtaining financing. List prices of new-homes held steady, though most builders indicated that they have cut back on discounting. Sales contracts were found across all price-point categories. Reports of higher prices for lumber, shingles, and concrete were widespread, rising mainly in the mid-single digits. Sales of existing homes continued to show improvement, although inventory is tight in the mid-price range.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|10|Retailers reported a modest improvement in sales during August and September relative to year-ago levels. Consumers have responded positively to new lines of fall merchandise and back-to-school sales were characterized as good. Some retailers noted that consumers in middle-income brackets have entered a holding pattern until after the elections. Our contacts expect growth in the fourth quarter to be in the low-to-mid single digits relative to 2011. Vendor pricing has been stable, with little change in shelf prices. Grocery store chains reported that their costs have risen due to the summer drought. Attempts at passing through higher food prices were met with mixed results. Capital spending for the year remains on target. Two retailers noted that they may accelerate spending before year's end, mainly for distribution equipment. No permanent hiring is expected other than at new stores. The number of temporary workers expected to be hired for the upcoming holiday season is planned to be a little higher than last year.
cleveland|Banking|2012|10|Demand for business credit moved slightly higher since our last report, with requests mainly for commercial loans and refinancings. Several small business owners told us that it remains difficult for them to obtain credit. The interest rate environment was described as very competitive. Consumer lending was up a little, driven by demand for auto loans and home equity lines of credit. In the residential mortgage market, activity is fairly strong. Although a majority of applicants are still looking to refinance, many bankers noted an increase in new-purchase requests. No changes were made to loan application standards. Delinquency rates continued to improve across consumer loan categories; however, several bankers reported an uptick in delinquencies from commercial customers. Core deposits grew, especially in transaction accounts. Bankers expect little change in payrolls for the remainder of this year.
cleveland|Energy|2012|10|Conventional oil and natural gas production held steady during the past six weeks, with little change projected in the upcoming months. Wellhead prices for natural gas rose slightly. Drilling rigs are migrating from other states to Ohio to take advantage of the higher-priced wet gas found in the Utica shale. To date, 375 permits have been issued in Ohio for drilling horizontal shale gas wells. Thirty wells are now producing, with 50 expected to be in production by year's end. Coal producers reported production declines in 2012 of between 10 and 50 percent over prior-year levels due to lower demand from electric utilities and a stricter regulatory environment. Reports of idled mines are widespread. Spot prices for export metallurgical coal declined further, while domestic steam coal prices rose slightly due to tight supplies. Production equipment and materials prices were flat in most categories, other than for diesel fuel. Capital outlays remain at projected levels. Several coal operators announced layoffs. In Ohio, a regulatory agency more than doubled its employment size over the past 12 months to cope with expanding shale gas activity.
cleveland|Freight Transportation|2012|10|Reports on freight transport indicated that volume is returning to normal trends after a second-quarter slowdown. Industries which contributed to the pickup include automotive, construction, and shale gas. However, lower-than-expected harvests have negatively impacted revenues for some carriers. Most of our contacts believe that their companies' growth objectives for 2012 will be met. Apart from fuel prices, costs associated with truck maintenance held steady. Carriers have successfully passed through higher diesel prices via a surcharge. Reports on capital spending were mixed. Half of our contacts said that 2012 expenditures are on track. Others reported a slowdown or postponement in purchasing new trucks, citing a sluggish economy, uncertainty about the fiscal cliff, and difficulty obtaining financing. Hiring is for replacement and adding capacity. Recruiting qualified personnel remains difficult, which is contributing to wage pressures.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|10|Most District merchants reported that sales growth remained slow in September. Discount retail operations outperformed traditional department stores. Most retailers projected continued soft growth in sales through the end of 2012. Contacts in the auto industry reported that strong sales levels were maintained in September.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|10|District residential brokers indicated that recent existing home sales were up slightly compared with year-earlier levels. Buyer traffic also remained ahead of year-ago levels. Brokers again noted declining inventories, which continued to put upward pressure on home prices in many markets. Contacts anticipate modest home price gains over the next year; however, it is expected that neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosures will continue to experience home price weakness for some time. The short-term outlook for home sales remained positive overall, with the majority of contacts anticipating modest gains.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|10|While noting that new orders continued to slow, manufacturing contacts reported mild increases in production, employment, and finished inventory levels in September. Regional auto and auto parts producers, as well as firms that supply materials to the energy exploration and extraction sector, continued to report strong levels of production, but most other durables manufacturers noted a slight deceleration in output. Nondurables output, with the exception of food and chemicals, remained soft.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|10|Banking contacts reported an increase in demand for mortgage loans for both purchases and refinances, although some contacts noted fewer than half of the applications actually were approved. The improvement in demand for purchase loans was driven by activity in entry-level homes. Demand for auto loans remained strong. Business lending had increased slightly; however, contacts noted most of the increase was not organic loan growth but was primarily from customers switching from other lenders or credit cards.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2012|10|Regional employment growth picked up slightly in September, but remained muted. Reports indicated that sectors related to energy, autos, and housing were experiencing most of the hiring activity. Reports also cited deepening ties between private employers, education representatives, and government officials in an effort to address training deficiencies for in-demand positions. The majority of contacts reported that stagnant demand is the major reason behind sluggish employment trends, although uncertainty related to fiscal policy continued to weigh on some firms' hiring plans.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|10|After brief, precautionary shut downs related to Hurricane Isaac, regional refiners fully restored operations with very little damage from the storm. Energy industry contacts continued to report that Gulf Coast refineries were undertaking investments to increase production capacity following refinery closures elsewhere in the country. Natural gas prices continued to experience downward price pressures. Contacts continued to note that inexpensive natural gas had prompted downstream manufacturers to relocate overseas operations to the U.S., prioritizing locations near refining operations.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|10|Retailers report that sales activity has remained flat in recent weeks. A major retail chain reports that sales in the region were sluggish in August and especially in September, running well below comparable 2011 levels. Some of the weakness is attributed to unseasonably mild weather, which dampened sales of seasonal merchandise. A major mall in upstate New York describes sales activity as "stagnant", with sales flat to down slightly from a year ago in August and September. The pricing environment is described as quite promotional, and acquisition costs of goods are characterized as mostly stable to declining modestly. Auto dealers in upstate New York report steady sales activity. New vehicle sales were up 6-9 percent from a year earlier in August but are projected to be flat to up slightly in September. Sales of used cars have been mixed since the last report, while dealers' service departments note some slowing in business. Wholesale and retail credit conditions remain favorable.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|10|Residential real estate across the District has continued to improve. Housing markets in metropolitan Buffalo reportedly flattened out in August but picked up sharply in September. Northern New Jersey's housing market has shown further modest signs of improvement, and there has been a sustained pickup in rental apartment construction, as builders appear to see a persistent shift toward renting. Home prices across northern New Jersey appear to recovering gradually--an industry expert notes that foreclosures and distress sales are no longer pushing down prices of other properties, though they are dampening any increase. Manhattan's co-op and condo market has remained stable--both in terms of sales activity and prices. The upper end of the market has been relatively strong, partly fueled by foreign buyers. Market conditions are reported to have strengthened in Brooklyn and especially Queens in the third quarter, while Long Island's housing market is weak but stabilizing. New York City's apartment rental market remains robust: rents have decelerated a bit in recent months but are still estimated to be rising at a 6-8 percent annual pace.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|10|Manufacturers across the District indicate some further softening in general conditions since the last report, whereas contacts in most other sectors report that activity held steady. Both manufacturers and other contacts report little change in input price pressures since the last report, though a number of manufacturing contacts say they plan to hike selling prices in the months ahead.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|10|Small to medium sized banks in the District report increased demand for all loan types except consumer loans, where demand was unchanged. Bankers also report increased demand for refinancing. Bankers report some tightening in credit standards for the household sector: roughly one in five bankers report tighter standards for consumer loans and residential mortgages, while no respondent reports easing standard in any individual loan category. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories except for consumer loans. The decrease in spreads was most prevalent in commercial mortgages. Respondents also indicate a decrease in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers report some decrease in delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgages but no change for consumer loans and residential mortgages.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|10|Growth in consumer spending was little changed in late August and September following a slight pick-up in the previous reporting period. Sales of back-to-school items were somewhat below retailers' expectations despite higher store traffic volumes. Contacts noted that the rise in gasoline prices had further deterred consumers from increasing discretionary spending. Retailers lowered their expectations for the holiday shopping season, although they still expect holiday sales to match last year's pace. Auto sales increased in August before moderating some in September. Consumers responded strongly to model year-end incentives, depleting inventories of 2012 models, and also benefitted from easing auto credit conditions.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|10|Business spending continued to increase slowly in late August and September. A number of contacts reported that firms were delaying hiring and capital expenditure decisions until they were more certain about the outlook for federal tax and spending policies. That said, some capital expenditures were proceeding as planned, particularly on software and equipment. Inventories were generally indicated to be at comfortable levels. Labor market conditions were weaker on balance. The District unemployment rate edged up and hiring remained selective. A recruiting firm indicated that overall demand for their services was effectively flat at last year's levels. Demand was greater in areas such as health care, engineering, accounting, information technology, and skilled manufacturing trades where firms are having difficulty finding qualified candidates. Several manufacturers reported stepping up training programs and increasing pay to meet staffing needs in a number of skilled trades.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2012|10|Growth in construction moderated some from the previous reporting period. Homebuilders indicated that new single-family construction continued to rise at a slow but steady pace, while multi-family construction was stronger by comparison. Loan standards for residential development remained tight, and many homebuyers also continued to face tight lending standards. Home prices edged higher, despite a rise in short sales. Nonresidential construction increased at a slower rate. Contacts indicated that new projects were progressing at a reduced pace; some also suggested that many firms were putting off investment decisions until after the November election. Elevated vacancy rates remained a drag on new commercial construction, and contacts noted that bank lending for investment properties continued to be limited.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|10|production edged lower in late August and September. Contacts reported that new orders had slowed considerably from earlier in the year and that order backlogs were coming down. Nonetheless, a number of contacts also indicated that quoting activity for next year had picked up, suggesting to them that the recent slowdown may be a pause due to the upcoming election and uncertain fiscal situation. Although the level of activity remained strong, demand for heavy equipment softened over the reporting period, largely reflecting further declines in the mining sector and a slower expansion of rental fleets. Exporters generally noted weaker demand outside of North America, particularly from Europe and Asia. Capacity utilization in the steel industry was steady, while steel service center inventories increased slightly. In contrast, the auto industry continued to be a source of strength, and manufacturers of building materials reported that activity had picked up with the recent improvement in the housing sector.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|10|Credit conditions continued to improve over the reporting period, with both credit spreads and market volatility decreasing. Banking contacts reported continued weak demand for business loans. While loan pricing was roughly unchanged, contacts cited greater demand for more flexible structures and longer financing terms. Standards continued to ease on C&I loans, although conventional financing remained difficult to obtain for many small businesses. Asset quality improved further, surpassing the expectations of some contacts. An exception was agricultural lending, particularly the livestock sector, where the impact of the drought on feed costs is putting stress on operators' balance sheets. Consumer loan demand was again limited with moderate increases in auto lending and mortgage refinancing, as auto loan standards continued to ease and mortgage rates moved lower.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|10|Cost pressures increased some in late August and September, primarily due to a rise in food and energy prices. Contacts also reported increases in the prices for construction materials like lumber and drywall, while most metals prices were steady. Wholesale food and energy price pressures rose, and retail contacts noted an increase in pass-through to consumers. Wage pressures remained moderate, although some upward pressure on wages for high skilled positions was cited. A few contacts also reported upward pressure on healthcare costs.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|10|The corn and soybean harvest began a few weeks earlier than normal across the District, as plants were dry due to the drought. In some areas, late rains helped produce higher- than-anticipated yields, but these made only a small dent in the large drought-related losses. Crop quality also was an issue in parts of the District. The drop in crop volume hurt grain elevators relatively more than crop farmers, as payments from crop insurance and sales at high prices offset much of the loss in farm income from the drought. However, given insurers' limited processing capacity and the large number of claims, already existing delays in crop insurance payments are likely to get worse. Corn and soybean prices eased down from their peaks, providing a bit of relief for livestock producers, though most operations remained unprofitable. Milk and cattle prices moved higher, while hog prices fell. Many hog facilities are operating below capacity, pointing to future reductions in supplies of pork.
dallas|Prices|2012|10|Most reporting firms said prices were steady. Several contacts in the transportation services industry noted higher diesel prices led to higher costs. Shipping firms expect higher ground and air prices as a result. Airline industry contacts noted that business travelers were very price sensitive and soft demand was keeping a lid on fares. Food and cattle producers noted price increases due to continued commodity price pressures.
dallas||2012|10|PricesMost reporting firms said prices were steady. Several contacts in the transportation services industry noted higher diesel prices led to higher costs. Shipping firms expect higher ground and air prices as a result. Airline industry contacts noted that business travelers were very price sensitive and soft demand was keeping a lid on fares. Food and cattle producers noted price increases due to continued commodity price pressures.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|10|Employment held steady or increased at most firms. Shortages of truck drivers continued to be reported in several industries. Accounting and legal firms noted increased hiring and said compensation has risen this year. Staffing firms reported additional hiring in response to high levels of demand, but there were no reports of pressures on wages or salaries. Skill shortages remained an issue for energy services firms, although some large firms noted slight easing. Retailers said hiring increased since the last report and expected holiday hiring to be stronger than last year.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|10|Overall demand for construction-related products was mixed over the last six weeks. Producers of stone, clay, glass and lumber reported steady to slightly increased demand, with particular strength in residential activity. Fabricated metals contacts said growth in demand had slowed. Reports from primary metals contacts were mixed, although a large electrical wire manufacturer said demand in August was stronger than in any other month this year. Across the board, contacts noted uncertainty in their outlooks due to the upcoming election.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|10|Retail sales growth softened over the reporting period, and sales are up slightly year-over-year. Sales in the Eleventh District continue to outperform the nation, according to two national retailers. Contacts noted that holiday hiring has begun or will begin soon, and hours worked are up from the previous report. Commodity input costs are easing, but the drought has caused prices for grains and feedstock to rise. The outlook for the rest of the retail quarter, which ends in October, is mixed but contacts are cautiously optimistic for the fourth quarter.
dallas|Services|2012|10|Staffing firms said demand growth slowed slightly but is expected to turn around in coming weeks. Demand from the steel industry was very strong, with contracts extending through 2014. Engineering and mortgage processor jobs were in high demand, while the need for oil workers has "become less crazy." There were fewer requests for workers in the plastics industry. Outlooks remained fairly optimistic.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|10|Single-family housing activity continued to increase at a good pace over the past six weeks. Contacts said new and existing home sales outpaced expectations, and new home construction activity increased. Inventories of both new and existing homes remained tight, leading to price gains. Apartment construction picked up since the last report, and outlooks for the multifamily sector remain quite optimistic. Leasing activity in the office and industrial real estate sectors remained steady at a good pace. While commercial construction remains at low levels, contacts expect activity to improve.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|10|Overall, financial firms reported flat loan demand. Auto loan demand, particularly for new autos, was a bright spot, and energy-related lending remained strong. Business lending and commercial real estate lending were weak. Loan pricing remained very competitive and has squeezed profit margins. Loan quality continued to improve as delinquency rates trended down and new loans are granted to more creditworthy customers. Deposits kept growing even as rates remained very low. Outlooks were mixed, and contacts said fiscal worries were negatively impacting loan demand.
dallas|Energy|2012|10|Respondents at energy-related firms said business remained strong with long lead times, although the District active rig count declined modestly over the reporting period. Producers concentrated their production on oil, as the prices of both natural gas and natural gas liquids remain very low. Outlooks were essentially flat. Activity was robust but there is little hope for further improvement through the end of the year.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|10|The District remained largely in drought, although scattered rainfall improved soil moisture conditions in several areas. Crops were mostly in fair to good shape. Production is expected to be better than last year--when the drought was much more severe in the Eleventh District--but below average because of ongoing dry conditions. Grain prices remained high due to the Midwest drought, adversely affecting Texas' large livestock sector as feed costs reached record highs.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|10|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to hire new employees, open new plants, or expand operations, while fewer manufacturers reported plans to lay off workers or close plants. Firms in poultry processing, furniture, commercial printing, boat, conveyor equipment, HVAC equipment, and industrial gas manufacturing plan to hire new workers, open new facilities, or expand current operations. In contrast, firms that manufacture iron and steel products, mining equipment, and food products plan to lay off workers or close existing facilities.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|10|Home sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, August 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 15 percent in Louisville, 6 percent in Little Rock, 11 percent in Memphis, and 17 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District. August 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits increased 41 percent in Louisville, 27 percent in Little Rock, 39 percent in Memphis, and 17 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|10|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased 1.4 percent from mid-June to early September. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.3 percent of total loans, increased 0.2 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.8 percent of total loans, increased 1 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of total loans, increased 2.5 percent. All other loans, accounting for 6.2 percent of total loans, increased 16.4 percent. During this period, total deposits at these banks increased 0.2 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|10|The condition of pastureland in the Eighth District has improved significantly from early August to late September. Excluding Mississippi, where 97 percent of pastureland was already rated as fair or better, the fraction of pastureland in fair or better condition has increased by at least 20 percentage points in all District states. The share of crops in fair or better condition has similarly increased across the District, although the condition of the corn crop remains relatively unchanged. Harvest completion rates have outpaced their 5-year averages for almost all crops in all District states. In particular, harvest completion rates for corn and rice are on average 30 percentage points ahead of their 5-year averages. Total year-to-date coal production in the states comprising the District, with the exception of eastern Kentucky, was 9 percent higher through the end of August than it was in the first eight months of 2011. August production, however, was 6.8 percent lower than in August 2011.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|10|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have continued to report overall declines in shipments, but a slight increase in new orders. Makers of lumber and wood products; stone, clay, and glass products; fabricated metal products; and instruments have reported gains since the last Beige Book. Lower activity was reported by makers of primary metals, industrial machinery, and electronic equipment. One manufacturer summarized the broad economic climate as a summer slowdown with sequential improvement, marked by a definite increase in August.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|10|Overall, Third District retailers reported little change between the modest year-over-year sales growth in August compared with July, although one contact stated that his store experienced the strongest Labor Day weekend in years. This year's sunny weather certainly helped compared with last year's storms. One department store manager reported that back-to-school sales did well, cold-weather clothing is moving better than last year, and discretionary "fun" items are selling well.  contacts are bullish for the upcoming holiday season, speculating that people will be primed to respond to upbeat holiday advertising after the long, negative political campaign season. An expectation of greater seasonal hiring has been widely discussed. And the holiday calendar provides a 32-day shopping season--the longest possible.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|10|Overall, Third District financial firms have reported continued growth since the previous Beige Book. Loan volumes grew modestly across most categories. Contacts describe fierce competition for small business loans from large and small banks. Despite high charge-off rates and ongoing household deleveraging, credit card outstandings have been virtually flat since the last Beige Book. Most contacts report that the financial health of households, businesses, and financial institutions continues to improve. The overall outlook among lenders remains positive.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|10|Residential builders reported a drop-off in traffic and slower sales in August and early September--a disappointing conclusion to their primary sales season. Builders lament that people are choosing to rent rather than buy even when local rents exceed the total cost of owning a home. Residential brokers reported somewhat stronger year-over-year sales growth in August than expressed in the last Beige Book and continued strength into September. Inventory levels of real estate listings remain at lower levels than one year ago with no signs of a large emerging shadow inventory. Multiple bids are reported for homes priced between $250,000 and $400,000; more very high-end listings are beginning to appear and test the market. Builders and brokers remain cautiously optimistic.
philadelphia|Services|2012|10|Third District service-sector firms have reported mixed growth since the last Beige Book. Tourist areas along the Delaware and New Jersey shores, in the Poconos, around Philadelphia, and throughout central Pennsylvania have reported strong visitation and/or lodging numbers relative to recent years. Atlantic City casinos and some neighboring shore areas were exceptions. Jersey shore businesses expressed considerable disappointment over cautious tourist spending; Delaware shore business also noted some caution. However, the tourist season concluded on a high note as the Labor Day weekend benefited by comparison to last year when severe weather disrupted end-of-summer plans. District staffing firms reported little change in orders, hiring mix, and wages. One firm continued to report extremely busy orders for manufacturing workers--better than in recent years--but expects a seasonal decline beginning in October. Demand for professional/business and health-care staff remains slower. Defense-related firms reported that there are fewer large contracts on which to bid and that they have continued to lower their expectations for 2013 and 2014 as sequestration or an alternative budget deal nears. Overall, other service-sector firms report a modest but positive outlook for six months out.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|10|Price levels have continued to show little overall change since the previous Beige Book. Once again, cost factors have risen slightly among manufacturing firms but the increase is less than it was during the previous Beige Book; prices received by manufacturers fell. Homebuilders and retailers indicated few significant changes in their cost pressures or prices they charge. One homebuilder attempted to raise prices but couldn't make them stick. Real estate contacts continue to report that lower-cost homes have reached a price floor in most markets and are beginning to rise slightly in some neighborhoods. Leasing agents have been unable to charge higher leasing rates in nearly all markets, except for industrial space along the corridor from Carlisle, PA, to the Lehigh Valley. Contacts from all sectors report little or no wage pressures, other than for medical benefits.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|10|Consumer spending was mixed but generally reported to be flat to up slightly over the latest reporting period. Retail sales were said to have improved modestly in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, while sales were characterized as flat to softer in the New York and Kansas City Districts. In general, retail sales were reported to be running only modestly ahead of a year ago. A number of reports noted various factors affecting sales, such as rising gasoline prices, political uncertainty, concerns about the "fiscal cliff" and weather. Atlanta and San Francisco noted that discounters have been outperforming traditional department stores. Cleveland reported that back-to-school merchandise sold well, while Chicago said that such sales were below expectations. Boston noted a pickup in furniture sales, Richmond cited brisk sales at building supplies stores, and San Francisco reported stronger demand at restaurants and food-service establishments.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|10|Residential real estate showed widespread improvement since the last report. All twelve Districts reported that existing home sales strengthened, in some cases substantially. Selling prices were steady or rising. Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco noted declining or tight inventories, which have put upward pressure on prices. Modest price increases were reported in the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. New York and Richmond reported relatively strong demand at the high and low ends of the market, whereas Philadelphia and Kansas City noted relative strength for mid-range homes; Boston indicated a shift in the mix toward lower or medium priced homes. New home construction and sales were more mixed but still mostly improved: increased construction and/or new home sales were reported in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Multi-family construction, in particular, was described as robust in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Residential rental markets continued to be characterized as strong, even in the New York and Atlanta Districts where rents increased somewhat less strongly than in recent months.
summary|Manufacturing|2012|10|Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed since the last report, though on balance, more Districts reported that conditions had improved than worsened. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported that activity expanded, though growth was generally seen as modest. Activity was reported as mixed in the Dallas District, while the New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported that activity weakened, though declines were mild for the latter two. Significant gains in manufacturing related to the construction, energy, and transportation sectors were reported across several Districts, with particularly robust gains tied to the automotive industry. There were exceptions in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts where manufacturing related to transportation equipment was reported as mixed.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2012|10|Activity in nonfinancial services was stable to slightly stronger since the last report. The Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that service-sector activity expanded, while such activity was reported as steady in the New York District and mixed in the Philadelphia District. Richmond noted that business activity strengthened for professional, scientific, and technical service firms, and Dallas noted strength in energy, accounting, and audit-related services. There was an increase in activity for a wide range of consulting services in the Boston and Minneapolis Districts. Activity related to health care was reported to be stable in the San Francisco District, but increased significantly in the Boston District. San Francisco reported continued sales growth for a wide variety of technology services, and noted that demand picked up for restaurants and other food-service providers.
summary|Banking and Finance|2012|10|Overall loan demand increased slightly on net since the last Beige Book report. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported stronger loan demand on balance, while Kansas City and Dallas reported flat demand and Chicago reported somewhat weaker demand. Most Districts reported an increase in mortgage lending, especially for refinancing purposes. New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported some increase in demand for commercial and industrial loans, while demand for business loans was weak in Chicago and Dallas, and was characterized as mixed in Richmond. Demand for consumer credit, particularly for auto loans, was said to be strong in the Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while consumer loan demand was more limited in New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|10|Agriculture conditions were mixed since the last report. Drought conditions continued to hurt the agriculture sector in the Chicago District, parts of the Minneapolis District, and the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. However, agriculture activity was reported as higher in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, as well as in parts of the Minneapolis District, and was reported as stable in the San Francisco District. The Chicago and Dallas Districts noted that increased rainfall had improved crop conditions. In the Dallas District, crops were reported to be mostly in fair to good shape, with production levels ahead of last year but below average due to ongoing dry conditions. Producers in the St. Louis District reported that crops were generally in better condition than at the time of the previous report, and harvest rates for corn and rice were well ahead of their five-year averages. Contacts in the Atlanta District reported that the rise in some crop prices related to the drought in the Midwest led to an increase in crop production in the Southeast. Higher feed prices continued to adversely affect livestock producers in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, though the Chicago District noted some easing in higher feed prices which provided a bit of relief.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|10|Employment conditions were little changed since the last report. The Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated that employment levels were flat or up slightly, with stagnant demand and uncertainty related to the upcoming presidential election, U.S. fiscal policy, and European debt issues cited by some as restraining hiring. The New York and Chicago Districts noted weaker labor market conditions, and conditions were described as mixed in Richmond. Firms in the St. Louis District reported an increase in hiring plans. Several Districts continued to report that employers were having difficulty filling highly skilled positions. In response, a few Districts noted that firms were starting to increase training programs to meet their staffing needs.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|10|District manufacturing activity firmed somewhat after having softened in earlier months. An auto supplier reported that his firm's sales continued to exceed expectations, which required overtime and additional hiring. A manufacturer of wallboard indicated that sales at his company rose, with the last few weeks being the busiest this year. A manufacturer of residential door frames said that demand in late summer was fairly flat, but he expected sales to improve over the next six months. In contrast, a producer of electrical components cited very weak business conditions, which resulted in layoff announcements and plans to close the factory at the end of this year. According to our latest survey, growth slowed in prices of both raw materials and finished goods over the past month.
richmond|Retail|2012|10|sales reports from our contacts were mixed, with modest improvement on balance. In Virginia, a grocer stated that customer counts were up, but shoppers were spending less, while another grocery contact commented that he will be opening several new stores by early next year. A major building supply firm reported a significant increase in the volume of wallboard sales; other inputs for major renovation work also picked up. Several small retailers said that they were preserving margins by reducing payrolls and cutting expenses. However, collections on customer accounts have become a bigger problem, according to one contact. Merchants remained somewhat guarded in their outlook for spending during the holiday season. Small retailers were conservative with inventories; they expected that their suppliers would be flexible enough to make quick shipments if reorders should be needed. To help push early purchases, several big-box retailers were advertising a return of their lay-away programs, and other merchants started offering lay-away for the first time. In addition, a number of internet retailers were offering an online lay-away program. District automobile sales varied, according to dealers. A contact at a large dealership reported high foot traffic, observing that buyers gravitated to "the deals," such as substantial rebates.  prices rose at a somewhat slower pace in recent weeks, according to our latest survey.
richmond|Services|2012|10|Non-retail services providers reported slight gains overall since our last report. Business activity strengthened for professional, scientific, and technical services firms; a contact at a Maryland telecommunications firm noted that demand was strong for tech-related security services. However, there were also reports that the possibility of government spending cuts associated with sequestration caused firms to delay business decisions. One industry executive commented, "We are hoarding cash." Healthcare firms continued to restructure to accommodate the post-reform environment in that sector. According to a contact at a private healthcare group, that organization had begun shifting away from low margin, basic services. A Virginia airport executive noted that increased passenger traffic in recent weeks had recovered from a drop earlier in the summer. Prices moved up more slowly at services firms.
richmond|Finance|2012|10|Lending activity improved marginally from weak levels since our last report. One banker reported continued strength in refinancing demand, which accounted for three out of four commercial loan applications. A North Carolina banker noted that, while most home mortgages were for refinancing, applications were fifty percent above normal levels and over one third were for either purchasing or building a home. Demand for commercial loans across the District was mixed, according to several contacts, with modest improvements coming from the medical, legal, and other services-related segments of the market. An official at a large bank described consumer demand as remaining weak, with the notable exception of auto loans, while business loans for capital equipment improved slightly. Several bankers stated that credit standards remained tight for consumer loans, but some easing had occurred in order to capture attractive commercial loan applications. A commercial banker said that uncertainty about whether a successful SBA program would be renewed had curtailed his ability to get approval of several viable small business loans.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|10|Residential real estate activity improved since our last report. A Realtor in the Richmond area said that closings were up double digits over last year and prices were rising slightly. Properties below the $200,000 range, in particular, were selling more quickly. However, an agent in the D.C. area indicated that housing sales in the $800,000-plus range were rising relatively quickly, adding that the lowest inventory for housing in eight years was pushing up prices. A Realtor in the Fredericksburg area reported that her agency was extremely busy for this time of year and indicated that sales were up forty percent over last year; she expected the stronger market to continue. Moreover, a Maryland contact mentioned that foreclosures in central Maryland had fallen thirty percent from the previous quarter, which bolstered housing prices. In contrast, a report described the housing market in North Carolina as mostly unchanged, with the exception of an improvement in the Research Triangle. Also, a source stated that there had been a slowdown in housing in the Hagerstown area.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|10|We received mixed signals on labor market activity over the last few weeks. A source from West Virginia reported that the state experienced several major layoffs related to mine closings and bankruptcies. A contact in Hagerstown said that the local labor market continued to recover, but at a slow pace, and that the area would lose a major manufacturer later this year. Moreover, an auto supplier in Virginia stated that his firm had frozen hiring and would reduce staff through attrition. In contrast, several employment agencies cited an increase in demand for workers, particularly among goods-producing industries. At a North Carolina staffing agency specializing in finance, companies were actively hiring staff and senior level accounting and finance professionals. In the retail sector, an industry representative mentioned that many small retailers expected to add hours for permanent employees during the upcoming holidays, rather than hire seasonal workers. According to our recent surveys, average wages in both the manufacturing and services sectors were growing at a slightly quicker pace than a month ago.
richmond|Tourism|2012|10|Hoteliers, restaurateurs, and other tourism contacts reported stable but solid leisure business going into the autumn season. In addition, their outlook was upbeat for late fall and early winter. An hotelier in western Virginia stated that business was solid, with a trend toward more last-minute leisure bookings. A tourism contact in Washington, D.C. reported seeing "tour buses galore" and crowds on the mall. Tourist activity on the outer banks of North Carolina was steady, and good attendance was expected for upcoming music and food festivals. Hotel and rental rates were not being discounted, although incentives were offered for time slots that were difficult to fill. In contrast, hotels that depend heavily on government-sponsored bookings reported a significant drop in business.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|10|Consumer spending slowed modestly and contacts were less optimistic about future sales in the months ahead. Retail sales declined slightly from the previous survey, but remained above year-ago levels. Several contacts cited political uncertainty and rising gasoline prices as key reasons for the slowdown. Expectations for future sales also eased somewhat, while store inventories were largely unchanged. Growth in auto sales was less robust than previous months, and expectations for future sales weakened slightly. However, several auto dealers in Oklahoma noted higher sales due to strong energy activity in their areas. Contacts said sales were strongest for mid-sized family sedans and crossover SUVs, while sales of full-size trucks and SUVs remained weak. Auto inventories increased and most dealers anticipated levels to increase further. Restaurant sales slowed markedly and expectations also fell. Some contacts noted higher food costs, rising gasoline prices, and overall consumer uncertainty as reasons for the decline. Tourist activity edged lower, slightly more than the usual seasonal slowing, and most contacts expected further decreases in the months ahead.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|10|Manufacturing activity in the Tenth District continued to expand, although at a slower pace than in previous months. Factory orders and shipments declined, while future hiring plans generally remained positive. Machinery production fell considerably since the last survey, with some contacts citing European weakness and political uncertainty as key reasons for the slowdown. In contrast, metals and transportation production remained solid. Manufacturers' capital spending plans moderated somewhat, but firms still indicated overall plans for expansion. Transportation activity was flat, although several firms reported higher shipments of perishable food products and more firms reported an increase in capital spending plans. Expectations for future transportation activity eased slightly from the previous survey. Sales growth among high-tech firms remained somewhat sluggish, with several firms citing political uncertainty as a contributing factor. However, expectations for future activity were more positive, and capital spending plans were generally favorable.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|10|Solid growth in residential real estate activity continued in late August and September, while expansion of commercial real estate activity slowed somewhat. Housing starts edged higher, and limited availability of workers was reported as an issue for some builders in states with low unemployment rates. Expectations for future homebuilding remained favorable, and building materials were generally available. Despite the improvement in housing starts, sales at construction supply firms were considerably slower, and many businesses were pessimistic about future sales. Home sales continued to grow at a solid pace, though slightly slower than in the previous survey. Residential realtors said mid-range homes sold well, while the luxury home market was still exceedingly slow. Several contacts noted a rise in sales to investors, as higher rental rates have increased profit potential. Expectations for future home sales flattened somewhat, but prices were generally rising and expected to increase further. Mortgage lending activity eased slightly, and one contact noted continued tightening of underwriting guidelines. Growth in commercial real estate activity slowed marginally from the previous survey, but was generally solid overall and most contacts remained optimistic about future months. Vacancy rates continued to fall, but absorption rates flattened out. Office prices and rents were also flat from the previous survey, although some increases were anticipated in coming months.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|10|In the recent survey period, bankers generally reported steady to stronger loan demand, improved loan quality, and increased deposits. Overall loan demand was favorable as most respondents reported stable demand for commercial real estate and consumer installment loans, while demand for residential real estate and commercial and industrial loans edged slightly higher. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories. The majority of bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and nearly all banks expected the outlook for loan quality over the next six months to be the same or better. More institutions reported stronger deposit volume than in the previous survey.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|10|activity remained solid in late August and September. Contacts continued to report reduced activity related to natural gas exploration, but oil rig counts remained strong and were expected to stay relatively stable. Natural gas prices remained very low, although several contacts anticipated a slight increase in prices due to lower levels of exploration and winter supply concerns. Crude oil prices climbed higher from the previous survey period, which several contacts attributed to continued Middle East conflict concerns. One producer noted an increase in service activity particularly in Wyoming and North Dakota, but contacts reported minimal shortages in equipment and labor.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|10|Drought continued to hurt agricultural conditions across the District. Dry, hot weather accelerated crop maturity, prompting an early corn harvest with below-average yields. The soybean crop was rated in mostly poor condition as harvest began. Winter wheat planting was progressing normally, but low soil moisture could delay emergence. Corn and soybean prices fell seasonally, but concerns about global production underpinned wheat prices. Despite drought conditions, high crop prices and crop insurance payments were expected to boost farm income and more than offset lower livestock profits due to higher feed costs. District bankers indicated ample funds were available for qualified borrowers to meet cash flow needs and finance carry-over debt. Demand for farm loans remained modest amidst a pull-back in capital spending. Farmland values rose further and were expected to remain at high levels.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|10|The majority of prices continued to rise moderately with further increases expected, but wage pressures were mostly contained outside of a few skilled positions. Retail prices edged higher, and were anticipated to rise further in coming months. Prices of manufacturing materials continued to increase, although fewer firms planned on raising selling prices. Construction materials prices also moved higher, particularly for oil-related products such as shingles. Transportation firms reported higher input prices, and increased food costs continued to impact profit margins and selling prices for restaurants. Many contacts noted that rising gasoline prices have increased input costs and cut sales volumes. Wage pressures were still generally contained in most industries, although some firms reported continued difficulties in obtaining skilled labor, such as truck drivers, construction workers, software programmers, and engineers.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2013|1|Upward price pressures were limited on balance during the reporting period. Price movements for energy items were mixed: retail gasoline prices fell, and electricity prices rose in some areas. Prices for some intermediate materials used in the construction sector, such as drywall and steel rebar, ticked up, while log and pulp prices remained flat. Prices of grapes and nuts increased, and higher prices for grains and corn due to the drought earlier in the year boosted prices of grocery dairy and meat items. A restaurant chain reported menu price increases in the 2 to 3 percent range.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2013|1|Retail sales were on a par with or up slightly from last year's holiday season, but generally did not meet vendors' expectations. Online retailers experienced more robust sales growth than traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Inventories generally were at or near desired levels given the pace of sales, although some retailers reported having an excess of winter apparel due to relatively mild weather conditions, while others ran short on certain consumer technology products. Contacts in the information technology sector indicated strong sales of newer hardware and games, but relatively weak sales of established goods as well as some Internet and digital media products. Both sales and margins were soft for grocers. New automobile sales remained solid, running well above levels from 12 months earlier, with year-end gains expected to be sizeable.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2013|1|District manufacturing activity was mixed across sectors but expanded overall during the reporting period of mid-November through December. With healthy demand for fuel efficient planes and a sustained backlog of orders, production activity for commercial aircraft and parts has been running well above levels from last year. Demand continued to grow at a modest pace for pharmaceutical and wood product manufacturers. By contrast, capacity utilization remained relatively low for manufacturers of technology equipment, and defense manufacturers have been trimming payrolls due to expected federal spending reductions. While demand for scrap metal remained somewhat weak by historical standards, that for steel products used in automotive manufacturing and in infrastructure and nonresidential construction improved. Contacts indicated that production activity picked up at petroleum refineries.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2013|1|Agricultural output gained further, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production continued to expand. Demand for most crop and livestock products continued to advance and was met in part through more intensive use of capital equipment. Extraction activity expanded on balance for petroleum and natural gas, and natural gas inventories remained at historically high levels.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2013|1|Housing demand in the District strengthened further, while demand for commercial real estate was largely stable. Both prices and sales transactions of homes climbed in most areas, stimulating continued growth in home construction activity. In some regional markets, activity ratcheted up for higher-priced homes. Construction activity for multifamily residential projects grew further, in response to rising rents and tight availability of lower-priced homes. Demand for nonresidential space was largely stable. However, contacts reported that in select geographic areas of the District, substantial growth of technology firms has boosted demand for office space.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2013|1|Contacts from financial institutions reported that loan demand was unchanged or up somewhat. Business loan demand was characterized as moderate. Banking contacts continued to highlight ample liquidity and generally stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to well-qualified business loan applicants, with community banks facing increasing competition from larger national banks for small business lending. Although owner-occupied commercial real estate financing is readily available, banks in most regions remain reluctant to lend to real estate investors outside of the multifamily residential sector. Contacts noted a slight slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in the District's technology, Internet, and digital media subsectors. Consumer lending expanded further, primarily for automobile purchases and new or refinanced home mortgages. Reports indicated that credit quality for both business and consumer loans has continued to improve, albeit at a slow pace.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2013|1|One contact reports a small single-digit year-over-year decrease in December sales while the others cite increases ranging from near zero to 7 percent. Demand remains strong for clothing, shoes, and furniture. Responding retail firms expect to hold their selling prices steady based on an absence of price increases at the wholesale level. These contacts anticipate that 2013 will be characterized by low single-digit growth in sales.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2013|1|Manufacturing in New England continues to expand at a modest pace according to First District contacts. Of 11 responding firms, seven report higher sales in the fourth quarter than in the same period a year earlier, although in some cases the gains are quite modest. Two contacts in the semiconductor industry continue to report a cyclical downturn in their business. A contact in aerospace says that sales of parts for new airplanes are extremely strong but depressed conditions in the aftermarket have spread from the United States to Europe. A contact in the chemical industry says that while sales in pounds fell, the pricing picture improved so much that sales in dollars are up. Sales of frozen fish continue to be weak. The "fiscal cliff" was an explicit problem for a computer firm that sells almost exclusively to Defense Department customers who are worried about sequestration.
boston|Selected Business Services|2013|1|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report generally positive results for the fourth quarter. Several contacts report modest growth, while two contacts--whose firms have experienced rapid growth over the past two years--experienced a leveling off. Marketing and advertising contacts report a slight uptick during the fourth quarter and are confident that business conditions have finally stabilized after the recession, which hit them with a lag. Two contacts with exposure to health care note robust demand for services related to health-care IT implementation and drug-impacts research. At the same time, firms focused on the pharmaceutical industry have experienced slow growth, although one contact expects that pharmaceuticals will start to emerge from its rough spell in 2013. Economic consulting remains strong because of high levels of complex high-stakes litigation; management and strategy consulting contacts report flat business conditions as clients uncertain about fiscal policy and the macroeconomy remain reluctant to invest in consulting services.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2013|1|Across most of the First District, leasing activity in the final weeks of 2012 is described as very light, driven by a combination of seasonal factors and uncertainty stemming from fiscal cliff negotiations. However, a Portland contact notes an uptick in leasing activity in that city in December, especially in the warehouse sector, although office fundamentals remain flat amid slow employment growth. Boston's warehouse market improved as well, while the city's office vacancy rate remains high--also attributed to slow employment growth--and the trend toward office downsizing persists. In Hartford, the fate of large downtown properties that experienced foreclosure in 2012 remains uncertain; a key question is whether current owners will reinvest in the properties or resell them as is. Demand for commercial real estate loans in the region appears to be softening, while the pipeline of new construction projects in Boston has diminished significantly since the last report.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2013|1|Across the First District, contacts report strong year-over-year growth in sales for November in both single-family home and condominium markets. Similar to previous reports, contacts attribute continued growth in sales to low interest rates, affordable prices, and rising rents. Contacts say that buyers have become more confident about purchasing a home as economic conditions continue to improve. As buyer activity increased, inventory levels fell throughout the region. Contacts argue that declining inventory levels have now translated into higher prices in most areas. The median sale price of homes rose year-over-year across the First District, with some states experiencing significant increases.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|1|Overall consumer spending was up slightly relative to a year ago. The holiday shopping season was somewhat stronger than last year, with bigger gains in North Dakota and Montana. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer were flat in December compared with a year ago. A Minneapolis area mall reported that holiday traffic was level from a year ago, but sales were up. Activity at a shopping center in South Dakota was relatively level from a year earlier. A North Dakota mall manager reported that December sales were about 10 percent higher than last year; jewelry sales were particularly strong. Retailers in the Great Falls, Mont., area generally reported a solid holiday season. According to the Minneapolis Fed's business outlook survey, 30 percent of respondents expect increases in consumer spending in their communities during 2013; 25 percent expect decreases. These results were similar to last year's survey.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2013|1|Commercial construction activity increased at a solid pace since the last report. The permitted value of new commercial construction in December was up 26 percent in Sioux Falls, S.D., and the value of November permits more than doubled in Billings, Mont. A major outlet mall is planned for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Residential construction increased considerably from a year ago. The value of November residential building permits in Billings was up 70 percent from last year, and the value of December permits in Sioux Falls was up 39 percent from a year ago. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, December residential permits were up 17 percent compared with December 2011.
minneapolis|Services|2013|1|Activity at professional business services firms grew since the last report.  sector respondents to the business outlook poll expect sales volumes and capital investment at their firms to grow in 2013. An appraisal company noted that demand is increasing for its services, and the backlog continues to increase. Another appraiser noted, "I am turning down more business than I am accepting."
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2013|1|District manufacturing increased slightly since the last report. According to a December survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.), manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and South Dakota after five consecutive months of decreases. Activity also increased in North Dakota, but at a slower pace than in recent months. The Minneapolis Fed's 2012 survey of manufacturers indicated that respondents on average expect orders, production, employment and profits at their operations to increase in the coming year. The outlook for capital investment was flat. A company announced that it is opening a 40,000-square-foot cereal ingredient processing facility in South Dakota.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2013|1|Activity in the energy sector continued to grow, while mining slowed. District oil production remained at record levels. An oil refinery in Minnesota announced plans for a $400 million upgrade in order to process more oil. Late-December oil and gas exploration activity decreased slightly in North Dakota and increased in Montana from the previous month. A railroad put on hold its plans to expand a coal-shipping line from Wyoming, citing a weaker outlook for domestic coal. Iron ore production remained strong in northern Minnesota; however, recent months were down from levels earlier in 2012. A large mining company announced that it will idle some of its production at operations in Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula in 2013, citing lower ore prices and reduced global demand. A mining company increased its estimate of deposits at a potential copper, nickel and precious metals mine in northern Minnesota.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2013|1|was steady at high levels. Crop prices came down somewhat recently but remain relatively high, a slight relief to livestock and dairy producers who have been hammered by high feed costs. The selloff of livestock herds continued. Sugarbeet producers in Minnesota and North Dakota saw a record crop in 2012, but prices were down. Prices received by farmers increased in December from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, chicken, dairy products and cattle. Prices for hogs, turkey, eggs and dry beans decreased. According to the Minneapolis Fed's third-quarter (October) survey of agricultural credit conditions, farmland prices continued their rapid rate of increase.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|1|Labor markets tightened modestly since the last report.A manufacturer in Minnesota recently announced plans to open a new facility that would employ 400 new workers. Up to 300 employees are expected to eventually work at a call center in Minnesota. However, an iron ore plant idled 125 workers, and a high tech company laid off over 40 employees in Minnesota due to a slowing in demand. According to respondents to the business outlook poll, 28 percent expect to increase hiring during 2013, while 15 percent expect to decrease staff, similar to last year's poll.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2013|1|Reports from District factories indicated that new orders and production were flat or down slightly during the past six weeks. Companies seeing increases were largely suppliers to the motor vehicle and energy industries. Compared to a year ago, production activity was mixed. Steel producers and service centers described shipping volume as lower relative to levels seen in the third quarter. Many of our contacts expect a slight weakening in business activity during the next few months due to seasonal factors and uncertainty surrounding the outcome of fiscal policy issues. Auto production at District plants showed a moderate decline during November on a month-over-month basis. Relative to prior year levels, production was largely higher, especially for foreign nameplates.
cleveland|Real Estate|2013|1|Home builders reported that the upturn in sales of new single-family homes continued into December. Although a seasonal slowdown is expected, builders expressed confidence that sales will pick up again in the spring. Contracts were found mainly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories. The number of single and multi-family housing starts in December was significantly above year-ago levels. List prices of new homes are increasing, which was attributed to shrinking inventories and rising construction costs. Builders have cut back on discounting. Tight lending standards are still seen as restraining the effect of low interest rates for builders and home buyers. Multi-family developments are expected to be the driving force behind new housing construction during the next one to two years.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2013|1|Reports on the holiday shopping season were generally solid. Most retailers were encouraged by results during the Thanksgiving weekend, and a majority said that sales during this holiday season were above those of a year ago. However, some contacts reported that sales figures fell below expectations for the entire season. Increased volume was seen particularly in electronics and apparel. Sales for the first quarter of the new year are expected to trend higher relative to prior-year levels. Vendor and shelf prices held steady. Capital spending remains on target. A majority of our contacts reported that they plan to increase outlays slightly during 2013, particularly for warehousing, store improvements, and e-commerce. Little new hiring is anticipated, except for staffing new stores.
cleveland||2013|1|Consumer SpendingReports on the holiday shopping season were generally solid. Most retailers were encouraged by results during the Thanksgiving weekend, and a majority said that sales during this holiday season were above those of a year ago. However, some contacts reported that sales figures fell below expectations for the entire season. Increased volume was seen particularly in electronics and apparel.

A majority of our contacts reported that they plan to increase outlays slightly during 2013, particularly for warehousing, store improvements, and e-commerce. Little new hiring is anticipated, except for staffing new stores.
cleveland|Banking|2013|1|Demand for business credit was steady or down slightly since our last report. Some contacts cited a rise in the number of applications for commercial real estate loans and refinancings, but on balance, demand was little changed across sectors and product categories. Several bankers noted that their loan-to-deposit ratio was much lower than desired. On the consumer side, reports indicated an increase in drawdowns on home equity lines of credit and rising credit card receivables, which were attributed to holiday shopping. A few bankers saw an increase in auto loans. Activity was strong in the residential mortgage market, with a large majority of applicants looking to refinance. Delinquency rates held steady or declined across consumer and commercial loan categories. Core deposits grew, with an ongoing transition from time-deposit to transaction accounts. Little change in banking payrolls is expected in the near term.
cleveland|Energy|2013|1|Conventional oil and natural gas production was stable during the past couple of months. Shale gas activity continued at a robust pace: in West Virginia, well output at the end of 2011 was up 138 percent from the prior year, and during the first six months of 2012, well output across Pennsylvania rose by 42 percent compared to the previous 6 months. In eastern Ohio, 187 wells have been drilled in the Utica shale in the past year, with 44 currently producing. Coal production for 2013 is expected to be flat relative to 2012 levels. Demand for thermal coal increased slightly due to colder weather and a slowdown in switching from coal to gas by electric utilities. Demand for metallurgical coal in the U.S. held steady, but declined from offshore customers, particularly those in Europe. Falling prices for metallurgical coal have leveled off, while steam-coal prices were mixed. Capital expenditures by conventional drillers and coal producers are expected to decline during the first six months of 2013. Production equipment and material prices were flat across most categories. Apart from shale gas companies, little hiring is anticipated during the next 6 to 12 months.
cleveland|Freight Transportation|2013|1|Reports on freight transport indicate that shipping volume has improved since the start of November after an unexpected drop-off during the prior two months. Some contacts attributed the boost to rising demand coming from the retail sector and areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Freight executives were fairly positive in their outlook for 2013, with the caveat that a resolution is reached on issues involving fiscal policy. Costs associated with truck maintenance held steady, while diesel fuel prices fell. Reports on capital spending were mixed. Some freight haulers said that 2012 expenditures reached targeted levels. Others reported a postponement in purchasing equipment for replacement and expansion due to a sluggish economy and supply issues related to Class 8 trucks. Spending in 2013 is expected to be similar to 2012 levels, and it will be mainly for replacement. Due to uncertainty about the economy, hiring plans for 2013 are tentative. Wage pressures were contained.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|1|District contacts reported cautious optimism following a robust start to the holiday season. While sales were better than expected over the Thanksgiving weekend, reports covering the entire holiday season showed that total sales, although above year-ago results, did not appear to meet expectations. Deep discounting was prevalent throughout the holiday season. Auto sales remained robust and truck sales were somewhat positive with sales of replacement vehicles driving the growth for that segment.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2013|1|The majority of District residential brokers reported that recent existing home sales were ahead of year earlier levels. Sales growth was strongest in Florida. Most brokers in the region again noted declining inventories and rising home prices. Buyer traffic remained ahead of the year-ago level by most accounts. For 2013, most anticipate home sales growth will continue to improve slowly.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2013|1|Manufacturing contacts in the region reported that new orders and production contracted in December. Finished inventory levels also declined from the previous month. However, nearly half of manufacturing contacts expect production to be higher than current levels over the next three-to-six months, up from just under one-third in November.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2013|1|Many banking contacts indicated loan demand had increased and they've added lending specialists to deal with current and anticipated demand. Competition for quality borrowers remained fierce and there was some indication that banks were more willing to increase their tolerance for risk. Auto lending remained active and some depository institutions noted more loan growth in November and December. Low rates encouraged mortgage activity, and purchases accounted for a larger share of mortgage loans than in the recent past. Community banks reported spending a larger portion of their income on compliance and remained concerned about increasing regulatory pressures.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2013|1|Since the last report, payroll growth increased mildly across the District, though contacts said that uncertainty over fiscal policy and healthcare costs tempered hiring decisions. Aggregate gains in job growth across the District were fueled largely by strong job growth in Florida and Louisiana. Contacts in Florida's leisure and hospitality industry reported moderately improved hiring expectations, while the construction, retail, and energy sectors in Louisiana saw relatively healthy increases in employment in November and December.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2013|1|Planned investments, ranging from reserve development to increased refining and petrochemical operations to new pipeline infrastructure, continued to take place in the energy sector. For example, preparation for development of a large gas-to-liquids (GTL) and ethane cracker complex in Louisiana was announced, which is expected to increase the region's production capacity for GTL diesel and ethylene. Separately, industry contacts maintained that higher margins for natural gas liquids and other associated products continued to warrant ongoing drilling in natural gas wells, despite low prices for natural gas. In the midst of an apparent surge in investment activity in the energy industry, District contacts continued to cite a shortage of specialized skilled labor as a significant hurdle facing expansion plans going forward.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2013|1|Holiday season sales were up modestly from last year but came in slightly below plan. A trade association survey of retailers across New York State indicates that sales were disappointing in the days leading up to Christmas as well as in the days after. A major retail chain indicates that sales were below plan in November and December but picked up fairly dramatically in early January. Retail contacts in upstate New York report that sales were flat to up compared to a year earlier. Retailers attribute the weaker than expected holiday sales to a combination of online shopping, mild weather, fiscal cliff concerns, and, in some parts of the region, slow insurance payouts to those affected by Sandy.  Retail prices were reported to be steady or up moderately.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2013|1|Residential real estate markets in the District were generally steady since the last report, with the storm having little discernible effect on the overall market. New York City's rental market appears to have lost some momentum during the final two months of 2012, as rents in Manhattan and Brooklyn retreated and were up only slightly from a year earlier. The inventory of available rental apartments, however, remained low in late 2012. Apartment sales activity in New York City was robust in the fourth quarter--particularly in Manhattan. A major appraisal firm attributes some of the high sales volume to looming tax changes and notes that there has been a flood of appraisal requests for tax-related financial planning. Prices are reported to be flat to up slightly. In contrast, an overhang of inventory has kept prices from rising in northern New Jersey and Long Island. Sandy disrupted construction activity in late 2012, though a contact in the homebuilding industry notes that construction sub-contractors are getting a great deal of work from storm-related repairs and reconstruction during a typically slow season.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2013|1|Contacts in the manufacturing sector continue to report little or no growth in activity though they remain mildly optimistic about the near-term outlook. Non-manufacturing contacts report some improvement in business conditions and have grown increasingly optimistic about prospects for 2013. New York City area firms--both manufacturing firms  and non-manufacturing firms--say that Sandy adversely affected revenues in November but that business was seen to be back on track in December.
new_york|Financial Developments|2013|1|Small- to medium-sized banks report no change in demand for all loan types except commercial mortgages, where loan demand increased. Bankers report little change in demand for refinancing. The vast majority of respondents continue to report that credit standards were unchanged across all categories. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over the costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly in residential mortgages, where nearly three in five bankers report lower spreads. Respondents also indicate a decrease in average deposit rates, on balance. Finally, bankers note declining delinquency rates in all loan categories--most notably in commercial mortgages, where well over half of those surveyed report lower delinquencies.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2013|1|Consumer spending increased somewhat from the previous reporting period. Retailers noted that holiday sales were slightly below expectations. Multiple retailers reported that store traffic volumes fluctuated more throughout the holiday season than in recent years. Apparel and jewelry sales were strong, while sales of toys and electronics were more in line with expectations, and general merchandise sales were weaker. Auto sales in the District lagged the national pace, with several dealers indicating that lower consumer confidence hurt year-end sales. Some auto dealers also noted that inventory levels were slightly high. However, dealers expected new car sales to be stronger in 2013 due to pent-up consumer demand, easing credit conditions, and rising used vehicle prices.
chicago|Business Spending|2013|1|Growth in business spending remained tepid in late November and December. Inventory investment was little changed while spending on equipment and structures continued to slowly increase. Some contacts again noted a reluctance to spend given heightened uncertainty related to federal fiscal policy. Labor market conditions were unchanged. Hiring plans for the coming year were limited. Retail employment increased with some seasonal hiring, but few significant full-time post-holiday additions were expected. A recruiting firm noted that customers that are heavily dependent upon government spending were very cautious about increasing headcount amidst the fiscal cliff negotiations. Companies with exposures to Europe were likewise being more conservative in their hiring plans. However, contacts indicated that there is still strong demand for talent in technology, engineering, accounting and finance, energy, and skilled manufacturing jobs. Manufacturers indicated a reluctance to reduce headcount despite the recent slowdown in activity, choosing to cut overtime hours instead in expectation of a rebound in production in the first quarter. In addition, some contacts are also beginning to limit hours for part-time workers to less than 30 hours in order to avoid the 30-hour (full-time employee status) rule related to the Affordable Care Act.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2013|1|Construction and real estate activity was mixed in late November and December. Residential construction continued to rise. However, homebuilders noted that new construction would stay moderate in many regional markets as long as existing home prices remained well below new home prices. Existing home prices did edge up in some areas of the District, and rental rates continued to rise. In addition, contacts reported that in many cases credit for homebuyers remained tight, slowing the pace of home sales. Demand for nonresidential construction remained weak, but some improvement was noted in the light industrial and office markets. Several commercial real estate contacts observed that uncertainty surrounding federal fiscal policy continues to weigh on structures spending in a number of market segments. However, commercial real estate conditions improved slightly. Vacancy rates continued to decrease; and while the pace of leasing and acquisition deals remained slow, it picked up slightly as financing became easier to obtain.
chicago|Manufacturing|2013|1|Growth in manufacturing production continued to be moderate over the reporting period. Capacity utilization in the steel industry increased slightly and service center inventories were noted to be at desirable levels. Specialty metal manufacturers reported a decline in quoting and new orders as customers continued to delay purchases until the last minute. In contrast, a contact in the defense industry noted a substantial rebound in orders due to the two-month delay in sequestration. Contacts noted a slight pick-up in demand for construction equipment due to improvement in the housing market, although demand from the public sector remained weak. The auto industry remained a source of strength for manufacturing. Auto suppliers reported strong orders through the end of the year, and many expected vehicle production to expand in 2013. Activity in the energy industry appeared to slow. The lower price of natural gas, in part due to abundant supply, has negatively affected coal mining. In addition, one contact noted the lower prices had also led to a pause in shale gas production. However, contacts expected activity in the energy industry to rebound in early 2013.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2013|1|Credit conditions continued to gradually ease over the reporting period. Credit spreads and financial market volatility remained low, and asset quality continued to improve. Credit line utilization rose substantially, with contacts citing end-of-year factors such as tax planning and special dividends as reasons for the increase. Banking contacts also reported moderate growth in demand for small business loans, particularly from manufacturing industries such as machining and packaging. Pricing for business loans changed little, while contacts cited some loosening of loan standards. Consumer loan demand, particularly for mortgage and auto loans, continued to increase. Contacts indicated, however, that less home refinancing activity was being processed than in the previous reporting period.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2013|1|Cost pressures eased in late November and December. Most raw material prices moved lower, although there was some pressure on lumber and drywall prices and concerns remained around potential food and energy price increases. In contrast, manufacturers supplying the defense industry said their customers were attempting to negotiate large price decreases; these contacts thought they could instead secure multi-year price agreements in exchange for more moderate price reductions. A contact in the grocery industry indicated that they have been unable to fully pass on recent meat and milk cost increases. More generally, retailers reported that discounting and promotions increased over the holiday shopping season. Wage pressures remained moderate, but nonwage costs increased. Contacts again cited higher healthcare costs; however, a few noted that increases this year were less pronounced than a year ago. Several contacts also reported increasing 401(k) payouts and year-end bonuses.
chicago|Agriculture|2013|1|Although drought conditions eased, depleted soil moisture remained a concern in much of the District. The low levels of the Mississippi River hampered barge traffic moving both crops to market and inputs to farms. Crop operations tended to come out ahead for the year if they had adequate insurance coverage, and most crop farmers saw their net worth grow. Uncertainty regarding the tax treatment of capital expenditures led farmers to move up purchases of equipment and other capital improvements into 2012. Corn and soybean prices slid during the reporting period. Milk prices decreased, while cattle and hog prices increased. Of these agricultural products, only hog prices were below the levels of a year ago. Farmland values trended higher, with an extra spurt of farm sales at the end of 2012 in anticipation of tax code changes. Cash rents for cropland increased as well for the upcoming season.
dallas|Prices|2013|1|Most respondents noted stable prices, although accounting and legal services firms reported a modest rise in billing rates and some transportation service contacts noted an increase in freight charges. Overall, costs were flat to up during the reporting period. Some construction-related manufacturers and transportation service firms noted higher input costs. An aviation manufacturer said they planned to implement price increases this month due to rising input costs. Feed costs for livestock were at record high levels, while prices of other agricultural commodities declined slightly.
dallas|Labor Market|2013|1|Employment held steady or increased at most responding firms. Reports of employment increases came from legal firms, auto dealers, and a few manufacturers. Retailers said employment was up from a year ago, and one contact reported difficulty in filling IT positions. Accounting firms reported hiring at a slower pace than the last report. Auto dealers noted difficulty finding qualified workers, and there were scattered reports of shortages of skilled workers at energy-related firms. Wage pressures remained largely subdued, although airlines reported upward pressure and some construction-related manufacturers reported plans to give cost of living adjustments in January.
dallas|Manufacturing|2013|1|Construction related manufacturers' reports were mixed. Lumber producers noted stronger sales due to strong single-family construction, but demand for other products remained the same or softened since the last report. Outlooks were uncertain, with some responding firms putting off major decisions until the fiscal cliff was resolved. Demand for fabricated metals also softened over the reporting period, although outlooks for 2013 were optimistic. Primary metals producers noted demand growth was slower than expected.
dallas|Retail Sales|2013|1|Retail sales volumes increased since the last report, mainly due to holiday shopping, and contacts said demand was up year-over-year. According to two national retailers, Texas continued to outperform the nation. Contacts were cautiously optimistic in their outlook for 2013; the largest source of uncertainty among contacts was the fiscal cliff.
dallas|Nonfinancial Services|2013|1|Staffing services firms reported mixed results. Most said that demand held steady, while one said orders had softened slightly. Contacts continued to be very concerned about new health care laws in 2014, and some noted their customers' outlooks were more uncertain due to fiscal concerns. Overall, staffing firms' outlooks were slightly more pessimistic than six weeks ago.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2013|1|Contacts in the single-family housing sector reported continued improvement in new and existing home sales. Despite increased construction activity housing inventories remain low, pushing overall prices up. Firms remain cautiously optimistic in their outlooks. Apartment demand continued to ease slightly overall, although occupancy rates remain historically high.
dallas|Financial Services|2013|1|Financial institutions reported modest growth in overall lending activity. The increase in corporate loan demand was mostly driven by customers opting to make purchases before year-end due to tax uncertainty, but there was also moderate growth in real estate lending activity. Consumer lending improved, with modest growth in mortgage and new automobile loan demand. Loan pricing remained extremely competitive, and deposits continued to grow despite very low rates. Firms' outlooks remained positive, with fiscal and regulatory concerns posing downside risks.
dallas|Energy|2013|1|Respondents at energy-related service firms said activity remained at high levels, despite a larger-than-expected decline in the domestic rig count driven by low natural gas prices. Although oil prices remain at healthy enough levels to support current activity, price volatility is making some firms nervous about drilling in higher cost fields. Contacts expect overall activity to be flat this year relative to fourth quarter of 2012, with some improvement expected in the second half of 2013.
dallas|Agriculture|2013|1|With little rainfall, most of the District remained in drought conditions since the last report. The drought is negatively impacting the winter wheat crop, and contacts are beginning to express concern for spring planting. Wheat harvest was mostly completed over the last six weeks, and production was up from 2011, mainly because the drought was less severe. Contacts noted that fiscal cliff concerns and the lack of a farm bill are creating a great deal of uncertainty.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|1|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been negative on net since our previous report. Several manufacturing firms reported plans to lay off workers and close plants in the Eighth District, while fewer manufacturing firms reported plans to hire new workers or expand operations. Firms in HVAC equipment, electric components, food, and automobile parts manufacturing reported plans to lay off workers. In contrast, firms that manufacture small arms and medical devices reported plans to hire new workers and expand operations.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2013|1|Home sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, November 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 16 percent in Louisville, 5 percent in Little Rock, 13 percent in Memphis, and 19 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District. November 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District's metropolitan areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits increased 40 percent in Louisville, 26 percent in Little Rock, 30 percent in Memphis, and 25 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2013|1|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 0.6 percent from early September to mid-December. Real estate lending, accounting for 72.4 percent of total loans, was little changed. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.7 percent of total loans, decreased 4.4 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of total loans, were essentially unchanged. All other loans, accounting for 7.1 percent of total loans, increased 1.7 percent. During this period, total deposits at these banks decreased 0.6 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|1|November year-to-date commercial red meat production across the District's states was 4.3 percent higher in 2012 than the same period in 2011. By contrast, November year-to-date poultry production as measured by the number of young chickens slaughtered was down 2.2 percent relative to 2011. The District's states ginned 6.4 percent less cotton from January 1 to December 15, 2012, compared with the same period in 2011. Year-to-date coal production in the District's states (excluding eastern Kentucky) at the end of November 2012 was 9.4 percent higher than the same period in 2011, while coal production for November 2012 was roughly on par with production for November 2011.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2013|1|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported that orders and shipments have recovered to a pace of slight growth. The mild pace can be partially attributed to seasonal trends. Comments from contacts focused primarily on small upticks, new product demand, and emerging markets, rather than on disappointing orders. Makers of food products, lumber and wood products, primary metals, fabricated metal products, and instruments have reported gains since the last Beige Book. Lower activity was reported by makers of industrial machinery and electronic equipment.
philadelphia|Retail|2013|1|Third District retail sales recovered to a modest pace of growth for the holiday shopping season after the disruptions of Hurricane Sandy, according to retail contacts. Sales reports were mixed for mid-market department stores and some home furnishing stores, which reported moderate early holiday sales gains followed by a lull, with slight declines from the prior year. High-end department stores, family apparel stores, and outlet stores reported modest or moderate year-over-year sales throughout the holiday period. Some substantial mall tenants posted strong double-digit sales growth. Until final sales are tallied, retail contacts relied on other early indicators to suggest that the final days of the holiday shopping season had grown modestly, or better. Traditional mall retailers continued to draw shoppers with promotions, while outlet stores used fewer promotions than in prior years. Shopper surveys revealed concern over the consumers' future paychecks from the pending fiscal cliff negotiations.
philadelphia|Finance|2013|1|Overall, loan volumes have continued to grow at a slight pace across Third District financial firms since the previous Beige Book. A flurry of year-end business lending kept banks busy facilitating tax-oriented business decisions involving sales and liquidations, mergers and acquisitions, accelerated depreciation, and dividend payouts. Home mortgage refinancing rates continued to remain high. In describing their competition as very aggressive, lenders expressed awareness of some potential portfolio risk, even while the credit quality of their borrowers continued to improve. Generally, financial institutions are expecting growth to continue, if not improve.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2013|1|Residential builders reported one final surge of contract activity in November and then a downswing in December to conclude with slight year-over-year growth for the period. Despite facing erratic swings in demand through the year, our contacts reported very strong year-over-year growth for the entire year, which is more indicative of their own gains in market share than of the sector overall. Residential brokers reported robust year-over-year sales growth in November, with steady year-end momentum. As with new home construction, existing home sales are growing from a low base. Builders and, to a greater extent, brokers are optimistic that recent growth will be sustained in 2013. As with other sectors, contacts expressed concern that the fiscal cliff negotiations had been extended into their important first quarter.
philadelphia|Services|2013|1|Third District service-sector firms have resumed a more modest pace of growth since the last Beige Book, according to contacts in various sectors. Tourist areas along the Delaware and New Jersey shores are in various stages of recovery from Hurricane Sandy. Atlantic City casinos reported significantly lower revenues in November (as much as $55 million) compared with 2011. Businesses and rental housing that serve the central and northern Jersey Shore communities continued to lose some of the money they would have earned in the low season. Southern New Jersey and Delaware beach communities are largely intact and operating normally. A Delaware beach hotel owner reported a strong December finish to the year, which was partly due to an extra holiday weekend. District staffing firms reported a mild pace of growth at year's end  an improvement after the storm disruptions. Staffing contacts expect moderate growth in 2013 but are watching their clients' reactions to the serial fiscal cliff decisions. Defense-related firms received no relief from the uncertainty of budget cuts that has held their business plans in stasis for the past year. Overall, service-sector firms expressed more confidence in their expectations for growth in the near future.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2013|1|Overall, price levels continued to increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Cost factors among manufacturing firms held steady, while the prices they received rose a little. Tighter auto inventories generate a price environment that favors auto dealers over their customers. Homebuilders noted that rising commodity prices had added about 3 percent to the cost of a new home in the past 90 days. In addition, roofing and siding contractors have lost crews to the Jersey Shore repairs. Real estate contacts continued to report that house prices are firming up and that houses in some markets are receiving multiple offers. Rents are rising in most segments of the Philadelphia central business district market and for industrial space along the corridor from Carlisle, PA, to the Lehigh Valley. In other segments and geographies, rents are flat or still falling. Contacts from all sectors continued to report that wages rose only a little, if at all. After a good year, two homebuilders reported issuing the first pay raises to their staffs in several years. Contacts did report strong growth in unemployment compensation and workers' compensation costs.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|1|Since the previous Beige Book, consumer spending increased to some degree in all twelve Districts. Across the nation, holiday sales grew modestly compared with last year but came in below expectations in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Boston reported continued strong demand for clothing, shoes, and furniture, and San Francisco reported robust online sales. A major retail chain in New York indicated that sales picked up in early January. Retail sales were flat in Richmond except for gains in food and auto sales. Expectations for future sales were positive but mild, particularly in Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas where contacts cited the impact of fiscal cliff uncertainty on consumer spending.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2013|1|Overall, nonfinancial services have grown modestly since the previous Beige Book. Businesses in the New York and Philadelphia Districts recovered from the disruption of Hurricane Sandy. The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported positive growth among various service sectors, while the Richmond District reported stable to stronger demand for service firms. Boston reported strong demand for some health-care IT services and drug impact research, while San Francisco noted relatively weak demand for health-care services. Staffing firms in the Dallas District reported steady to slightly softened demand. Respondents remained optimistic about growth over the near-term in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.
summary|Manufacturing|2013|1|Reports of manufacturing activity were mixed overall, with six Districts growing since the last Beige Book, three Distracts contracting, and two Districts reporting little or no change. Firms in the Boston and Chicago Districts reported continued expansion of activity at modest and moderate rates of growth, respectively. Overall activity once again appeared to expand in the San Francisco District, although it was mixed across sectors.  Gains in the aerospace and chemical sectors contributed to growth in the Boston and San Francisco Districts, as well as in the Dallas District.  in the Chicago District grew with contributions from the auto and housing-related sectors.  continued to expand, but at a more modest pace, in the Richmond District. Several firms cited falling export demand, especially from Europe.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2013|1|Existing residential real estate activity expanded in all Districts that reported; growth rates were described as moderate or strong in nine Districts. Contacts in the Boston District attributed their strong sales growth to low interest rates, affordable prices, and rising rents. All Districts reporting on price levels saw increases; New York and Chicago reported only very minor increases. The five Districts that reported on housing inventories all reported falling levels. New residential construction (including repairs) expanded in all but one District of those Districts that reported. Contacts in the Kansas City District reported that increased lumber and drywall costs limited construction, causing a slight decline this period. Hurricane Sandy disrupted construction activity initially in New York, but this has since led to increased work for subcontractors on repairs and reconstruction.
summary|Banking and Finance|2013|1|Overall, loan demand was largely unchanged in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, with most of these Districts reporting a continuation of slight to moderate growth in total volume. The New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported stronger demand than previously, while the St. Louis District reported a slight decline. Some increased lending in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas was driven by businesses taking out loans for special year-end purposes such as tax planning and dividend payments. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported strong auto lending. Demand for residential mortgages improved in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Commercial real estate lending was cited as a particular bright spot by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, lenders in San Francisco remained reluctant to lend to real estate investors outside of the multifamily residential sector. San Francisco also reported a slight slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in that District's technology sector.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|1|Reports of agricultural activity were mixed, although rain and mild temperatures delivered some relief from drought conditions to parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. Low water levels along the Mississippi River also hampered transport for some contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Despite the drought, some contacts in these Districts reported that farm income remained high with adequate crop insurance and historically high prices. Producers in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts expect ongoing dry conditions to hurt the winter wheat crop.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|1|Labor market conditions remained mostly unchanged in all Districts. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported delayed hiring, often in defense manufacturing, due to fiscal cliff uncertainties. Companies in the Chicago District with trade or investment exposures to Europe reduced their hiring plans as well. Chicago reported that manufacturers are choosing to cut hours instead of reducing head count in expectation of production rebounds in 2013. Atlanta and Kansas City cited health-care policy changes and costs as another cause for minimal hiring. On the other hand, the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts saw the labor market firming modestly. Finally, contacts in several Districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers in some specialized fields, such as skilled manufacturing, energy, and IT.
richmond|Manufacturing|2013|1|District manufacturing continued to expand, but at a more modest pace since our last report. A furniture manufacturer said that his business had improved through gains in market share and new product introductions, and that the improvement should continue in 2013. A spokesperson for the technology industry reported that 2012 was expected to be flat, but instead grew by ten to twelve percent. Another contact stated that, " is hanging in there," noting that niche markets were doing best, but only if they were not dependent on international demand. A producer of lumber products commented that sales volumes and orders dropped, in part because of Hurricane Sandy's impact on their customer base in the northeast. An electrical components manufacturer reported that business was "terrible," adding that his only sales were to replace ruined equipment from Hurricane Sandy, and that export orders to Europe had dropped off. According to our latest survey, raw materials prices were relatively flat, while finished goods prices rose at a slightly slower pace.
richmond|Ports|2013|1|The typical seasonal surge in import volumes shifted as a result of two major events. The first was the threat of an East Coast port strike that has loomed since the September 2012 expiration of the master contract between the International Longshoremen's Association and the U.S. Maritime Alliance. A number of shippers used alternative West Coast and Canadian ports ahead of the peak season to minimize disruptions to their businesses. Secondly, Hurricane Sandy caused diversions to Fifth District ports, boosting an already solid peak season. In addition, bulk fuel shipments that were diverted to the Northeast created "a pinch in supply" for companies located further south. Exports of resins for plastics, grains, forestry products and metal scrap were especially strong, with imports being led by beverages and retail goods. Both exports and imports of auto-related products were robust.
richmond|Retail|2013|1|sales flattened, with the exception of food and vehicle sales, according to most merchants contacted since our last report. Several blamed the lackluster sales on the federal government's failure to resolve its fiscal issues. Most retailers responding to a special poll indicated that they planned an equal amount of holiday discounting as a year ago. A West Virginia department store manager reported that sales were a little soft ahead of Christmas, while other retailers noted little change. In contrast, many grocers noted an uptick in revenues. Although big-ticket sales were weak overall, car sales rose by double-digit percentages in recent weeks. Federal fiscal indecision also pushed sales of heavy trucks, construction equipment, and buses at the end of 2012, ahead of the possible expiration of bonus depreciation. According to survey respondents, retail price growth slowed during the past month.

richmond|Services|2013|1|firms reported stable to stronger demand since our last report. An executive at a national freight trucking firm indicated that revenues flattened in the District, while another trucking company reported that demand slowed slightly, although that company was able to improve its margins. Demand strengthened at telecommunications and engineering firms, and a contact in Washington, D.C. remarked that law firms see regulatory practice as a growth industry. During the week of Christmas and New Year's Day, the CDC reported that the flu had become widespread across the District. An executive at a North Carolina healthcare facility commented that the "flu season hit early and hard," more than doubling the average number of cases for that time of year. Non-retail services prices rose slightly faster in recent weeks, according to survey respondents.
richmond|Finance|2013|1|Demand for both consumer and commercial loans varied across the District. A North Carolina lender noted that mortgages for new purchases of homes declined, in part because of economic uncertainty. However, a second North Carolina lender said new financing is outpacing refinancing at his bank. According to another North Carolina banker, the home mortgage business is improving and he indicated that refinancing has strengthened in his region; in addition, a number of lenders stated that the competition among lenders for refinancing business has been aggressive. Finally, a banking contact with several locations in the District reported that demand for consumer loans and mortgages had not changed much. Bankers in Maryland and West Virginia reported that foreclosures have slowed. A West Virginia banker said that while overall credit quality has been very good, residential mortgage delinquencies have crept up slightly, and that demand for commercial credit had been steady at a relative high rate in recent weeks. Another West Virginia banker remarked that his region's commercial and industrial loan demand had slowed because economic progress has been "lumpy." A banker in North Carolina reported that loan demand from businesses had remained weak despite lower borrowing rates, owing in part to economic uncertainty.
richmond|Real Estate|2013|1|Residential real estate activity continued to improve since our last report. A contact in South Carolina said that the real estate market was dynamic in the Charleston area and that demand and pricing were stronger than they had been in a long time. A Realtor in the Washington, D.C. area expects a strong market through early 2013, as the combination of record low inventory and low interest rates encourages new listings. A contact in West Virginia told us that home sales in his area have improved considerably and that prices were flat for the first time since the drop in values two years ago. Another source saw improvement in the "move up" market but little to no activity in the speculative market. He also remarked that the start-up market for housing remained flat and that the effect of student loans on credit scores was a cloud over the mortgage market.
richmond|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|1|Agricultural conditions remained favorable. Oil and natural gas production remained at high levels during the past six weeks. December was relatively mild across most of the District, with warmer than normal temperatures and significant precipitation. Small grain conditions improved with the added moisture, as did pastures and hayfields.
richmond|Labor Markets|2013|1|Conditions in labor markets weakened since our last report. There were several reports of soft demand for workers in part because businesses were reluctant to hire in the politically uncertain climate. Retail employment dropped sharply in recent weeks, and several service sector contacts indicated that hiring decisions were in a holding pattern. Exceptions were to fill vacated positions and to ease nursing shortages, and a Washington contact remarked that restaurants were paying bonuses to attract managers. Sources continued to report difficulty finding qualified workers to fill vacancies, particularly in advanced manufacturing. Two Virginia temporary employment agencies noted increased demand for high tech and highly skilled workers. According to an ad hoc poll, less than half of the retailers who made seasonal hires expected to offer those employees a permanent position after the holidays. Wage growth in manufacturing remained moderate, even among skilled workers, while average retail wages declined. In contrast, non-retail service sector wages continued to rise at a moderate pace.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2013|1|Consumer spending edged up in November and December, and sales expectations softened heading into the new year. Retail sales rose since the last survey period but retailers expected less growth after the holiday season. Several store owners noted that lower-priced items and home furnishings sold particularly well while sales of high-end items remained sluggish. Auto sales slowed but remained higher than a year ago and some dealers noted undesirably high inventory levels. Near-term sales expectations also eased but generally remained positive. Hotel traffic fell sharply and occupancy rates were substantially below last year's levels. Although tourist activity picked up somewhat, visitor counts remained well below a year ago and were not expected to improve in the near-term. Despite slightly better sales and higher selling prices, restaurant owners turned pessimistic about future sales growth as food costs mounted. Numerous contacts pinned their less positive outlook for future growth on uncertainty associated with the fiscal cliff that was inhibiting consumer spending.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|1|Manufacturing activity eased since the last survey period, particularly in the non-durable goods sector. Factory production retreated to year-ago levels after a more pronounced contraction in non-durable goods activity trimmed production over the past month. The relative strength of durable goods activity was supported by the production and sales of electrical equipment, appliances, and components. Manufacturers expected generally stronger activity over the next six months. Factory managers at non-durable goods plants, however, were more optimistic about future activity than their peers at durable goods plants with stronger expectations for production, shipments, and new orders over the next six months. Despite a potential rebound in manufacturing activity, factory employment was not expected to rise, with some manufacturers noting that they were delaying hiring plans because of uncertainty in tax and regulatory policies. High-tech service firms expected robust sales and capital spending over the next three months. With railroad traffic continuing to rise and flat sales expectations at transportation service firms, backlogs and capital spending remained solid.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2013|1|Residential and commercial real estate sales accelerated since the last survey period despite some weakness in new residential construction. Persistently strong sales of existing residential homes drove prices higher as home inventories continued to fall. Real estate contacts noted that low- to mid-priced homes continued to sell well. Overall mortgage activity and refinancings remained higher than a year ago although expectations for the coming months edged down. Despite recent strength at construction supply firms, sales deteriorated unexpectedly over the past month due partly to higher selling prices. Builders noted that surging lumber and drywall costs led to fewer housing starts in November and December. Commercial real estate markets also improved substantially since the last survey period. Vacancy rates continued to fall with a notable improvement in sales, absorption, and rents, although some contacts noted that economic uncertainty hindered activity. Rising commercial real estate prices were expected to persist in the coming months, but contacts expected a slower pace of both sales activity and absorptions.
kansas_city|Banking|2013|1|Bankers, on average, reported stronger loan demand, improved loan quality, and higher deposit levels in the recent survey period.  Overall loan demand continued to strengthen, led by demand for residential and commercial real estate loans. Respondents also reported stable loan demand for both commercial and industrial loans and consumer installment loans. Interest rates on commercial and industrial loans continued to edge lower. Most bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and they also expected the outlook for loan quality to continue improving over the next six months.  Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories and respondents also reported generally higher deposit levels since the last survey period.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2013|1|Drought continued to impact crop conditions and livestock profits improved with higher livestock prices and lower feed costs. District winter wheat conditions remained relatively poor due to persistent drought. The drought also caused water levels on the Mississippi River to fall further, hindering commodity transportation to and from agricultural regions. Still net farm incomes remained high due to historically high crop prices and crop insurance payments. Livestock profit margins also improved over the past six weeks due to a post-harvest decline in crop prices and rising livestock prices. District contacts noted a surge in land sales, sparked by concerns of tax policy changes in the new year.
kansas_city|Energy|2013|1|District energy activity contracted in November and December and was expected to slow further in the coming months. The number of active oil rigs in the District eased from the previous survey period despite a year-end uptick in crude oil prices. The number of active natural gas rigs declined as high supplies of natural gas in storage kept prices from rising due to winter heating needs.  contacts expected steady demand to stabilize oil prices and the current oversupply of natural gas to push prices lower. Wyoming's coal output dropped in December and annual production fell moderately short of year-ago levels. District ethanol production remained steady and profit margins, while still poor, improved slightly with easing corn prices.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2013|1|Although wage pressures remained subdued during the survey period, raw materials prices rose further and more companies expected to raise finished goods prices in the coming months. Many businesses reported delaying hiring due to uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff and health care policy. Yet, some firms were offering wage premiums to fill specialized positions, particularly in the energy, high-tech, transportation, and construction industries. Raw material costs at factories climbed higher, and more factories planned to raise finished goods prices over the next six months. Builders expected higher prices for many construction materials, particularly lumber and drywall, to continue climbing due to tight supplies. After rising during the holiday shopping season, retailers expected retail prices to flatten during the coming months. Restaurant owners planned to increase menu prices due to high food costs. In contrast, fewer bookings led hotel operators to reduce average room rates.

san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|11|Price inflation for final goods and services was limited during the reporting period. Contacts noted a recent uptick in the prices for energy inputs, particularly oil, and price increases for assorted food items at the retail level. However, the combination of robust supplier competition and lackluster final demand continued to hold down price pressures for most retail goods and services.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|11|Retail sales grew further on balance. Modest gains were noted for traditional department stores and discount chains alike, with particular demand strength for small appliances and other inexpensive household products. By contrast, sales were largely unchanged for retailers of major appliances, furniture, and electronics. Sales were largely flat for grocers, and industry contacts noted that they are keeping a close eye on inventories at the start of the holiday season to avoid overstocking. Sales of new automobiles continued to strengthen, with replenished inventories for some Japanese brands supporting sales gains in response to growing consumer demand. For the upcoming holiday retail season, contacts generally expect sales to match or slightly exceed the levels reached during last year's season.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|11|activity in the District firmed a bit further on net during the reporting period of October through mid-November. For manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, capacity utilization rates remained quite high; demand growth stayed positive but continued to slow, especially for components used in consumer electronics products. Production activity expanded a bit from existing high levels for makers of commercial aircraft and parts, as modest growth in new orders added to an existing backlog. Activity was largely stable or up slightly for metal fabricators. For petroleum refiners, weak domestic demand for gasoline was offset by robust domestic and export demand for distillate products, notably diesel fuel, holding overall capacity utilization rates near their long-term averages. Production activity continued to expand for food manufacturers, while demand stayed stuck at depressed levels for manufacturers of wood products.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|11|Demand growth and sales were robust for agricultural products, and extraction activity expanded further for minerals and natural resources used for energy production. Orders and sales continued to grow for assorted crops and livestock products, especially for those with extensive export markets. Contacts noted that agricultural input costs remained largely stable, with the exception of significant increases in the cost of fertilizer. Mining activity expanded further, propelled by high price levels for a variety of metals. Extraction activity grew for crude oil, largely in response to robust foreign demand, and demand for natural gas was largely unchanged.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|11|Home sales and construction remained anemic, and demand for commercial real estate was largely stable but weak. The pace of home sales was quite subdued, with contacts noting that despite low interest rates, relatively strict lending requirements have constrained purchasing activity. As a result of lackluster sales and the large number of financially distressed properties, the pace of home construction stayed depressed and home prices remained flat. By contrast, demand for residential rental units grew further. Demand for commercial real estate remained weak overall, as reflected in elevated vacancy rates and heightened caution by tenants to commit to long-term leases. However, declining vacancy rates were noted for selected geographic areas that are benefiting from growth in the technology sector, primarily the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. The vast majority of contacts expect demand in residential and commercial real estate markets to change little in the near term.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|11|Reports from District banking contacts indicated that loan demand was largely unchanged compared with the prior reporting period. With businesses remaining cautious in their approach to capital spending, the volume of new commercial and industrial loans stayed slightly depressed overall. However, reports continued to indicate stiff competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses, which has been creating downward pressure on rates and fees. No changes in demand for consumer credit were noted. Slight improvements in overall credit quality were noted, but lending standards remained relatively restrictive for many types of business and consumer loans. In a departure from prior positive reports, contacts from the venture capital sector reported a slowdown in investment activity and funding.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2011|11|First District retailers contacted in mid-November express less uncertainty about recent business trends than they did in early October; their estimates of 2011 annual sales are generally more positive and the 2012 outlook is more optimistic than last time. One large retailer selling both durable and nondurable goods reports that third quarter comparable store sales were up 3 percent over 2010:Q3. Another durable goods retailer reports that sales in recent weeks have been almost 5 percent above what they consider the benchmark for a solid sales week. Notably, a couple of contacts who last time expected 2011 sales gains of 4 percent or 6.5 percent from 2010 have now revised their estimates upward to between 7.5 percent and 8 percent. With one exception, responding consumer-goods retailers expect final 2011 sales to range from 6 percent to 8 percent over 2010, but one foresees annual 2011 sales to track 1 percent to 9 percent lower than 2010. Respondents say that consumers are regaining some confidence, although such comments are still tempered with caution, particularly regarding durable goods purchases. Budgeted pay increases range from 2 percent to 3.3 percent. Some contacts report ongoing wholesale price increases, while others say cost increases have moderated.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|11|The First District manufacturing picture remains mixed. On the whole, contacts report relatively strong performance continuing in recent months, but ongoing concern about potential weakness in the global economy is tempering growth forecasts and leading to only limited capital investment and hiring activity. Of the firms contacted this month, all but one recorded sales growth year-on-year and many report double-digit growth. The growth is broad-based geographically; most firms report strongest growth in Asia, followed by domestic sales, but even Europe results remain fairly robust, despite the sovereign debt crisis. One contact making laboratory instruments commented that "reports of Europe's demise are premature" but others are less sanguine about Europe. A major supplier to the auto industry reports a September year-on-year sales decline in Europe of 7 percent, but a year-to-date European sales increase of 11 percent, only slightly less than the almost-13 percent recorded in Asia.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2011|11|New England software and information technology contacts report continued growth, with year-over-year revenue increases ranging from mid-single digits to 20 percent in the most recent quarter. Contacts report upticks in demand across the board, including in the manufacturing, financial, and medical sectors. Increased activity has led all contacts to increase their headcounts relative to a year ago, many by over 5 percent; at the same time, many report continued difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified software engineers, programmers, and sales personnel. Respondents report annual wage increases for most employees between 3 percent and 5 percent, with one firm increasing the wages of software engineers by more. Many contacts express renewed concerns regarding the federal budget and the European debt crisis. Nonetheless, First District software and IT contacts are generally more optimistic than they were three months ago. With strong order pipelines, most are expecting revenue in early 2012 to be 10 percent to 20 percent higher than in early 2011.
boston|Staffing Services|2011|11|First District staffing contacts report mixed activity through the end of October, with some experiencing downticks and others posting modest increases. Year-over-year revenue changes vary widely, from flat to up by more than 25 percent. Labor demand is generally flat relative to three months ago, although a few contacts report upticks in the software-IT, manufacturing, and legal sectors. Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring continues to grow. Supply of high-end labor remains tight in the region, and a few contacts report difficulty finding medical assistants, CNC operators, and welders. Bill rates and pay rates are steady or up slightly, with most contacts attributing increases to more high-end placements as well as a tight supply of skilled workers. First District staffing contacts say they believe that the labor market is performing better in New England than in the nation as a whole; they express hope for more consistent growth in 2012.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|11|The majority of contacts in the First District describe conditions in commercial real estate markets as roughly unchanged since the last report, although some note small improvements in fundamentals. In Hartford, vacancy rates for Class A downtown office space continue to hover around 20 percent and leasing demand remains muted in light of a flat labor market. In Boston, office leasing activity is roughly steady at a moderate pace, although tenants reportedly lack a sense of urgency to sign deals. Boston's Back Bay and East Cambridge submarkets continue to show strong demand and relatively low vacancy rates, with the result that rents on Class A office space in Back Bay now exceed those for comparable space in Boston's financial district, where vacancy rates remain in the mid-teens. Portland saw modest absorption of retail and Class B office space and in recent weeks amid strong overall leasing volume, while some new vacancies arose in the Class A office market. Leasing demand tapered off in recent weeks in Providence, as suburban Rhode Island experienced a modest uptick in leasing activity.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|11|Sales activity in New England for single-family homes and condominiums continues to languish according to contacts throughout the region. Sales figures rose moderately in September compared to a year ago, but these increases reflect several months of dismal sales following the expiration of the tax credit in mid-2010. Respondents say housing market conditions have remained largely unchanged in the last several months. Most contacts characterize the market as stable and consistent, but believe the beginning of a recovery remains fairly distant. While low interest rates have made financing more affordable to qualified homebuyers, contacts report tighter credit standards as a constraint. The median sale price of homes also rose in September from a year earlier in the region, except for Rhode Island, where prices have been below year-earlier levels for several months. October data for the Greater Boston area, by contrast, show a 10.5 percent year-over-year decline in the median sale price of homes.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|11|Consumer spending grew moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in October increased about 3 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minneapolis area mall reported that recent sales were up between 3 percent and 5 percent, as cooler weather inspired shoppers to buy fall goods. According to the University of St. Thomas Holiday Spending Sentiment Survey, Minneapolis-St. Paul households are predicted to spend 3.4 percent more on holiday gifts than last year. Auto sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area increased since the last report, according to a domestic auto dealer. However, a Minnesota-based clothing retailer announced plans to close several stores and reduce its workforce. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's business outlook poll indicated that respondents expect slight increases in consumer spending in their communities and increased sales of their businesses' products and services.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|11|Commercial construction activity increased modestly since the last report. Respondents to a November Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey of commercial construction contacts reported an increase in construction activity for health care facilities and industrial buildings. However, the value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was down slightly in October from October 2010. Residential construction increased from last year. Several multifamily construction projects were announced or are under construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The number of permitted residential units in Minnesota was up in September from a year ago. However, in the Sioux Falls area, the value of residential building permits in October was level with the same period a year earlier.
minneapolis|Services|2011|11|On balance, professional business services firms expect increased activity. Based on results from the business outlook poll, respondents from the services sector expect to increase sales and capital investment in 2012. "Things generally are better," commented a Montana professional services firm.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|11|activity was mixed since the last report. An October survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed that production increased in Minnesota and North Dakota, but unexpectedly contracted slightly in South Dakota. Bank Directors noted that manufacturing was doing well with some equipment backlogs extending throughout 2012. Producers of storage bins for agricultural use reported strong demand. However, a window maker announced that it will lay off workers due to weak home construction. A large printing operation in Minnesota halted expansion plans due to uncertainty about the economy.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|11|The energy and mining sectors saw continued strong growth. Oil exploration activity increased in Montana since the last report, but decreased slightly in North Dakota. In North Dakota, regulators approved plans for a 105-megawatt wind farm, and three other wind energy projects are under review. A short line railroad reported that it saw strong demand growth from the wind energy and oil drilling sectors. District mines continued to operate at very high capacity utilization rates.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|11|Agricultural conditions remained generally strong. Farm financial conditions were very strong due to high commodity prices. Prices for hogs, cattle, turkeys and eggs increased in October; prices for corn, soybeans and wheat declined, but remain substantially above their year-earlier levels. The harvest went quickly, thanks to recent dry weather. District corn production was roughly even with 2010; however, soybean production was down more than 12 percent. Wheat production was down dramatically in some areas of the District.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|11|Labor markets showed some signs of tightening. In a recent survey of Minnesota manufacturers, 45 percent of respondents reported that skilled-worker shortages were a moderate or serious problem, particularly for skilled production and IT workers. A Minnesota recreational vehicle manufacturer reported that it isn't running a plant at capacity because of a surprising shortage of workers. A representative of a Minnesota employment services firm noted robust demand for temporary light industrial positions during September and October; demand for permanent positions was volatile. A South Dakota manufacturer reported difficulty finding qualified workers in order to expand operations. In Montana, a job fair indicated that employers were recruiting recent college graduates with engineering, business and computer science majors. According to the business outlook poll, 36 percent of respondents consider securing workers a challenge or serious challenge in 2012, up from 24 percent in last year's poll.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|11|New orders and production at District factories were stable along seasonal trends during the past six weeks. Compared to year-ago levels, output was mainly higher. Most of our contacts are cautious in their outlook but expect little change in demand during the upcoming months. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume was steady or slightly lower, with demand being driven by energy and industrial equipment industries. Steel representatives remain hopeful that current volume can be maintained, although some seasonal slowing is expected. District auto production held steady in October on a month-over-month basis. Compared to year-ago levels, output rose moderately, more so for domestic nameplates.
cleveland|Construction|2011|11|Single-family home construction remained sluggish, while activity in multi-family housing and remodeling expanded. Sales contracts were mainly in the move-up price-point categories. Several builders reported that difficulty in obtaining financing is preventing them from adding to their spec inventory. Little change is expected in residential building for the next one to two years. Not much difference was seen in the list prices or discounting of new houses since our last report. The pickup in hiring by general contractors that occurred late in the summer has diminished.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|11|Retailers saw a slight improvement in sales during October, when compared to September's results, with several of our contacts noting a pickup in purchases of cold-weather-related items and home furnishings. Transactions were also ahead of last year's levels, mainly in the mid-single digits. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, retailers expect stronger sales on a year-over-year basis. We continued to hear numerous reports about upward pressure on supplier costs, particularly for packaging, fuel, and agricultural commodities. A few retailers reported that suppliers have held off passing through the entire price increase, but they may be less reluctant to do so in 2012. Retailers were also selective about passing through rising prices to consumers. Reports on profit margins were mixed. Capital budgets remain on plan. Most of our contacts said that outlays during 2012 will not change appreciably from this year's levels, and that they will be used mainly for technology enhancements, e-commerce investments, and remodeling. Little change in payrolls is expected at existing stores. Seasonal hiring at some stores will be slightly higher than in 2010.
cleveland|Banking|2011|11|Demand for business loans showed a moderate improvement, although a few community bankers observed some weakening. Requests are being driven by energy, manufacturing, multi-family housing, and healthcare. Reports indicate continued downward pressure on interest rates for commercial credit. On the consumer side, our contacts described installment loan activity as flat or down; however, direct and indirect auto lending continued to show strength. Interest rates remain very competitive. Activity in the residential mortgage market has slowed since our last report, with most applicants looking to refinance. Many bankers noted a pickup in the number of applicants who are refinancing into 15-year mortgages. No changes were made to loan application standards. Overall core deposits continue to grow, although several bankers reported that the growth is being driven by business customers. Delinquencies were steady or declined across loan categories; any stress was mainly on the consumer side. Payrolls were stable, with little hiring expected in the near-term.
cleveland|Energy|2011|11|Conventional oil and natural gas production rose moderately during the past six weeks, while drilling was little changed. Our contacts were somewhat uncertain about future activity due to falling prices for natural gas. Well-head prices for oil were fairly stable. Activity in shale-gas extraction continued to expand. One report characterized production from confirmation wells drilled in Ohio's Utica shale as good. Coal output is expected to be stable for the remainder of this year, though increases are possible in 2012 as a result of growing demand from export markets and domestic utilities. There is some uncertainty surrounding utility demand due to abundant supplies of low-priced natural gas and regulatory compliance issues for coal-fired generators. Spot prices for coal showed normal fluctuations. Capital outlays are on target, with moderate increases projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming months. The cost of production equipment and materials was flat during the past six weeks.  payrolls held steady.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|11|On balance, freight transport volume was stable over the past six weeks and up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Rising demand was seen from the retail and energy (shale gas and coal) sectors. Our contacts expect volume to grow at a slow, steady pace in the near term. We heard numerous reports of rising prices for tires, parts, and equipment, and of some volatility in fuel prices. Much of the cost increase was recovered via fuel surcharges and rate adjustments when contracts came due. Capital outlays have accelerated during 2011 relative to prior-year levels. Spending is mainly to replace aging equipment and to support demand growth, especially from energy customers. All of our contacts reported hiring for driver replacement or adding capacity, although recruiting qualified drivers was difficult. Wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|11|The majority of District retailers reported weaker activity in October through mid-November compared with September. However, most merchants said sales were flat to slightly up compared with a year ago. Inventory levels remained largely unchanged as stores have continued with tight inventory management practices. Retailers anticipate holiday sales to be flat to slightly up compared to the same time last year. Auto sales advanced further, with dealers noting double-digit growth compared with a year ago.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|11|Residential brokers indicated that sales softened in October through mid-November compared with September, but were flat to slightly up compared with weak levels from last year. Several brokers noted that potential buyers continued to face challenges securing financing, while others said that deals were falling through because of changes to appraised values or negative inspection results. Contacts continued to report declining home inventories; however, despite fewer available homes, foreclosures and elevated levels of bank-owned properties continued to put downward pressure on home prices. District brokers anticipate sales growth to be flat over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|11|Overall, District manufacturing activity weakened slightly from October through mid-November. Contacts reported a slight increase in new orders, but production declined modestly. Logistics firms noted that retailers had adopted vendor-managed inventories, requiring the supplier to hold inventories until products were ready to be sold. Some manufacturers indicated they were more likely to produce and distribute on a made-to-order basis rather than taking the chance of being caught with excess inventory.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|11|Banking contacts described lending conditions as weak because of a combination of soft loan demand from qualified borrowers and strict regulatory requirements. Companies continued to reduce their debt loads and limited expansion plans and capital improvements.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|11|Contacts suggest that employment plans remained subdued across much of the District. Employers expect hiring to be modest, mostly to fill seasonal positions or critical vacancies caused by attrition. Many contacts noted plans to continue using temporary employees until there is a significant and sustained pickup in demand. Companies also indicated that they did not have any plans to cut employment further; employers felt that they had streamlined their operations as much as possible.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|11|Energy industry firms indicated that plans to invest in increased production capacity were proceeding. New drilling technologies have reduced costs and increased extraction capabilities for both oil and gas. In particular, contacts expressed that the cost of unconventional drilling continued to drop, allowing for more efficiencies and the ability to find and extract oil and gas.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|11|Non-auto retailers report that same store sales were mostly on or ahead of plan in October and the first half of November but little changed from a year earlier. Contacts at major malls in upstate New York indicate that sales activity was mixed in October but appeared to improve in the early part of November. One large retail chain indicates that sales in the region were down slightly from a year earlier in October and early November but still somewhat ahead of plan. Retail inventories are generally said to be at desired levels, while prices are reported to be flat to down slightly. Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales were steady to stronger in October and that dealers' service and parts departments continue to perform well.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|11|Residential real estate markets have been stable, on balance, since the last report, while home construction activity remains low--particularly for single-family homes. New York City's rental market continues to strengthen: asking rents remained on an upward trend up in October and were up 5 to 10 percent from comparable 2010 levels. Scattered reports from elsewhere in the District also point to strengthening rental markets. Co-op and condo prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn were mostly steady since the last report, while transactions activity dipped in October but turned up in early November. In northern New Jersey, home prices are reported to be down modestly, hampered by a glut of distressed properties; while fewer home mortgages are moving into delinquency status recently, there remains a large overhang of distressed properties. New home construction remains at a low level, with multi-family rental buildings accounting for most new development--in both New York City and northern New Jersey. Buffalo-area Realtors report steady home sales activity but some downward drift in prices; they also note a pickup in traffic at open houses.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|11|According to an industry contact, financial sector conditions remain adverse, with several thousand layoffs reportedly in the pipeline in the New York City area. This contact notes that regulatory uncertainty is hampering planning and causing shifts in resources among areas. While securities firms are reducing headcounts overall, they are still hiring in the legal and compliance areas. A major New York City employment agency reports that the job market has held steady since the last report with hiring activity described as moderate in October. Starting salaries have remained stable over the past year.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|11|Small to medium-sized banks in the District report increased demand for commercial mortgages but no change in demand in other loan categories. Bankers also reported an increase in the demand for refinancing. Respondents report tightening credit standards in all categories except residential mortgages, for which they indicate no change. Tightening of standards was most prevalent for commercial mortgages. Contacts report decreases in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories. Respondents also indicate widespread decreases in average deposit rates. Bankers report declining delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans, but no change in delinquencies for the other loan categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|11|Consumer spending increased in October and early November. Retailers reported moderate sales growth with consumers responding to an increase in promotions during the reporting period. Contacts expected retailers to use extended promotional periods and heavy discounting in an effort to keep traffic volumes steady over the upcoming holiday shopping season. Auto sales also increased in October, but the sales pace slowed in early November. Dealers indicated that consumers may be waiting to see what end-of-the year deals will be offered; they also were concerned that recent stock market volatility would weigh on consumer confidence and willingness to spend.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|11|Business spending was steady in October and early November. Several manufacturers said that they were reluctant to build inventories, as the elevated uncertainty surrounding the European and Asian economies had led them to take a "hand-to-mouth" attitude towards ordering. In contrast, contacts generally reported moving ahead with planned purchases of equipment and software. Most, however, indicated that hiring plans remained limited. Labor market conditions deteriorated, with some additional layoffs announced and unemployment in the District edging higher. In addition, growth in billable hours continued to moderate for staffing and professional services, although one staffing firm noted that permanent placements were increasing offsetting some of the decline in the demand for temporary workers.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2011|11|Construction activity was again subdued in October and early November. Residential real estate conditions remained depressed. Builders reported very little new single-family home construction, and showroom traffic was steady at a low level. Multi-family construction was stronger in comparison. Nonresidential construction increased moderately. Contacts cited continued growth in the industrial sector and an uptick in demand for medical and professional office space, while retail construction remained very slow. Commercial real estate conditions were little changed on balance with only a slight decline in vacancy rates reported.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|11|Growth in manufacturing production increased further in October before leveling off in early November. Demand for heavy equipment remained strong, led by robust activity in the energy sector. Contacts expected the growth in demand for equipment to moderate going forward, but also noted that the need to replace aging capital would continue to boost demand into next year. Manufacturers of specialty industrial metals also reported greater activity, driven in large part by the auto sector and exports. Auto production in the District continued to steadily improve, although the recent flooding in Thailand was reported to have challenged supply chains and impeded the recovery of dealer inventories of Japanese vehicles. Several contacts cited concerns that going forward moderately higher production levels would begin to strain capacity in the supply chain. In contrast, capacity utilization in the steel industry decreased, and orders coming into service centers were described as spotty. Furthermore, manufacturers of household appliances and construction materials reported declining demand.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|11|Credit conditions were little changed on balance during the reporting period. Volatility in equity markets remained elevated, and some additional flight to quality further boosted the demand for Treasury debt. Contacts noted the bankruptcy filing of MF Global Holdings Ltd. was disruptive for the company's former clients, with missing funds and uncertainty about the status of their futures and options positions limiting their ability to manage risk. Corporate funding costs generally edged lower as spreads narrowed relative to low benchmark interest rates. Banking contacts indicated that business loan demand continued to be muted by clients' reluctance to take on growth-oriented projects due to economic and political uncertainty. In addition, the lower liquidity in high yield and term loan markets did not seem to be causing much substitution of leveraged financing from bond and syndicated loan markets into individual bank loans. Business loan quality was noted to be stabilizing, with little additional improvement expected in the near-term.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|11|Cost pressures remained elevated, even though raw materials prices declined further in October and early November. Steel prices, in particular, moved lower over the reporting period. Contacts again reported extended lead times for specialty metals. In addition, tires were reported to be in shortage, with a contact indicating tight supplies are likely to persist until new plants come on-line in 2013. Wholesale price increases slowed, but cost pressures remained elevated for food, fabrics, diesel fuel, and shipping. Retailers reported they were absorbing most of these higher costs in their margins, but some pass-through to downstream prices continued. Wage pressures remained moderate.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|11|The corn and soybean harvests were running ahead of pace in the District, though yields were coming in below trend. For the District as a whole, more bushels of corn were harvested than a year ago, but soybean production was down. Crop storage on farms increased, as many farmers are expecting to sell their crops for higher prices in the future. This higher farm storage has led to relatively lighter supplies at grain elevators for this time of year, and end users, including ethanol plants, faced the prospect of higher prices. Corn, soybean, and cattle prices were up from early October, while milk and hog prices were down. With the exception of soybeans, these prices were up from last year, boosting farm incomes. There was another surge in farmland values and cash rental rates for the District.
dallas|Prices|2011|11|Price pressures were minimal across industries. Most contacts said prices were stable or down, although prices for new cars rose slightly and staffing and legal services firms noted modest increases in billing rates. The majority of respondents reported that raw materials prices were unchanged or down. The exceptions were producers of paper and of food who noted increased prices for some inputs. Contacts in the agricultural sector said cattle prices rose since the last report.
dallas|Labor Market|2011|11|Most firms reported steady employment levels, although there were reports of slight hiring activity. Staffing firms continued to note high levels of demand. Some oil services firms, primary metals and transportation manufacturers reported moderate employment increases, and said they continue to look for additional workers. Retailers said holiday hiring was ramping up, and one firm noted that they planned on hiring more seasonal workers than last year. Contacts in the auto sales and airline industries noted slight payroll increases. Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure for certain skilled positions was noted by airlines and a few construction-related manufacturers.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|11|Most construction-related manufacturers reported stable demand, although there were reports of stronger sales related to commercial, government and apartment construction projects. Construction-related outlooks were mostly unchanged, but a few contacts said they expect conditions to improve next year.
dallas|Retail Sales|2011|11|Retail sales growth moderated since the last report but showed continued gains over the comparable period a year ago. Cooler weather spurred winter clothing sales, and one retailer reported strong online sales. Contacts indicated that they are comfortable with level of inventories. Eleventh District retail sales growth trended roughly in-line with the nation over the reporting period, according to two large retailers. Overall, expectations are for modest growth this holiday season.
dallas|Services|2011|11|Demand for staffing services held steady at high levels. One contact reported engineering, IT and healthcare as strong sectors, and another mentioned solid demand for steel workers. Outlooks remain cautious but were more optimistic than the previous reporting period, with contacts expecting demand to remain flat or improve by mid-2012. Demand for accounting services was flat, and outlooks were unchanged. Legal firms reported steady demand, with a slight pickup in litigation activity and continued strength in intellectual property, energy and some real-estate related services.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2011|11|Contacts in the housing sector continued to note improvement. Inventories of existing homes fell further since the last report, and new home inventories remained lean. Single-family home sales are better according to contacts, but economic uncertainty is keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|11|Financial firms reported steady but soft demand for loans. National banks noted strong demand from large corporations but flat or declining middle-market lending activity. Regional banks said loan demand was flat, and loan pricing remained somewhat aggressive. The quality of loans outstanding continued to improve, with contacts noting a decline in problem loans. Outlooks are cautious, although contacts were less pessimistic than they have been over the past few months.
dallas|Energy|2011|11|Drilling activity remains strong, with 20 new land rigs added in Texas since the last report. Shale-directed activity continues at high levels. Revenues are growing and backlogs remain solid. Activity in the Gulf of Mexico also rose by six rigs, with new permits issued for deep water drilling.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|11|The District remained in drought, although severity lessened slightly in parts of Texas and New Mexico that received some rain in recent weeks. Planting of winter wheat continued at a fairly normal pace but the crop was in poorer condition than last year due to very low soil moisture. Livestock sell-offs continued at a slower pace, as many producers have already liquidated much of their herds. Grain prices fell slightly over the reporting period, largely due to lower export demand. By contrast, cattle prices were higher than six weeks ago and beef exports remained very strong.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2011|11|Contacts reported that retail sales in September and October were down slightly, on average, over year-earlier levels. About 46 percent of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 37 percent saw decreases and 17 percent saw no changes. Roughly 57 percent of the retailers reported that sales levels met their expectations, 33 percent reported that sales were below expectations, and 10 percent reported that sales were above expectations. About 17 percent of the retailers reported that their inventories were too high, while 9 percent reported that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook through the end of the year was mostly optimistic: About 58 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2010 levels, while 29 percent expect sales to decrease and 13 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's sales.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|11|Manufacturing activity has declined since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to close plants and decrease operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to open plants or expand operations. Firms in the primary metal product, surgical appliance and supplies, small engine, paper, and cleaning compound manufacturing industries announced plans to decrease operations and lay off workers. Additionally, a major firm in the refrigeration equipment manufacturing industry announced plans to close a plant and lay off a large number of workers. In contrast, firms in the fabricated metal product, clothing, appliance, hair care product, and air conditioning manufacturing industries announced plans to hire new employees.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|11|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, September 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 5 percent in Memphis, 6 percent in St. Louis, 7 percent in Louisville, and 9 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction also continued to decrease throughout the District. September 2011 year-to-date single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 10 percent in Memphis, 23 percent in St. Louis, 19 percent in Louisville, and 25 percent in Little Rock.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|11|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks indicates little change in overall lending activity in the third quarter of 2011 relative to the second quarter of 2011. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, and consumer loans remained basically unchanged, while the standards for commercial and industrial loans ranged from basically unchanged to somewhat eased. With the exception of the demand for commercial and industrial loans, which remained unchanged, changes in demand for these loans was mixed. The demand for commercial residential loans and residential mortgage loans ranged from relatively unchanged to moderately weaker. The demand for consumer loans, however, ranged from moderately weaker to moderately stronger.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|11|Winter wheat planting was ahead of its 5-year average completion rate in the Eighth District states, while the fraction of winter wheat crops rated fair or better was over 90 percent in all states except Mississippi. Monthly output of commercial red meat for September 2011 increased by 3.6 percent compared with September 2010. However, the total live weight and number of chickens slaughtered decreased by over 4 percent between August and September 2011. Year-to-date coal production at the end of October in the Eighth District was 3.8 percent higher in 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. Meanwhile, monthly production for October was 2 percent lower than in October 2010.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|11|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported modest increases in new orders and shipments. However, the improvement was uneven across and within sectors. Steady, modest growth was reported by various firms that supply or serve manufacturers. These firms expect continued overall growth from their manufacturing clients, despite citing ongoing small factory closures. Firms experiencing growth often cited business returning from China and India, or other market share gains. Other firms cited growth from Marcellus shale gas activity or from new product launches. Factors cited as impeding growth included underfunded public infrastructure, work going to China and India, and ongoing political uncertainty. The makers of food products, lumber and wood products, and primary metals reported declining product demand. Much of their decline is seasonal; they retained positive expectations.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|11|Third District retailers reported October sales gains compared with September as well as with year-ago levels. Cold weather and an early snowstorm triggered buying of sweaters and other cold weather gear. Prospects for holiday sales vary with the market segment. High-end, online, and outlet retailers are most optimistic. However, a concern was expressed over supply disruptions to some consumer electronics from the flooding in Thailand. Beyond the holiday season, a conventional mall retail contact expects sales to be down in 2012 from 2011, while an outlet mall contact anticipates new mall openings in the fall of 2012 and in 2013.
philadelphia|Finance|2011|11|Third District bankers have reported slight overall growth in loan volumes since the previous Beige Book. However, one banker described margins being squeezed as banks compete for share in a flat market. Another indicated they were picking up loans as foreign banks retreated from the market. Prompted by low interest rates, the strongest loan growth occurred in commercial real estate, home equities, and home mortgages, especially refinancings. C&I lending was flat. Credit quality continues to improve but at a slower rate. Among Third District bankers interviewed in November, business plans for 2012 assume further modest loan growth and challenging competition within markets.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|11|Residential building activity has increased somewhat since the previous Beige Book, while reports on existing homes sales indicated no change. Existing sales remain lower than last year's levels. Large print ads recently touted record low interest rates, low prices, and high affordability, possibly prompting the flurry of activity noted by one New Jersey builder. Buyers selected mostly a range of mid- to high-priced build-to-suit homes. These price points were also strong for a Pennsylvania builder as were lower-priced multifamily townhomes aimed at move-up and entry-level buyers. One builder noted that producers of many construction materials have shut down and that the supply stream will require 12 to 18 months to start up again after demand for residential construction picks up. There is no change in the relatively weak outlook among builders and real estate agents.
philadelphia|Services|2011|11|Third District service-sector firms have reported modest growth since the last Beige Book. Advertising was noted as a little soft with a particular weakness in retail. Freight volumes continue to grow, reaching pre-recession levels, according to a logistics firm. Staffing firms indicated that demand is slowing and that virtually all new placements are on a temporary or contract basis, rather than permanent, full-time hires. High-skilled workers, ranging from welders to new hires with business intelligence skills, remain in short supply. Staffing contacts expected little or no improvement by year's end; one was also less bullish for 2012.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|11|Few price changes have been reported since the previous Beige Book. One broad business sector supplier announced widespread price hikes for early December. Pricing power remains favorable for freight shippers and auto dealers. Most other sectors report very tight margins, although cost factors have generally remained flat. A few exceptions include cotton products for retailers and drywall for builders. Many bankers, builders, and leasing agents continued to report expectations for concessions from borrowers, buyers, and renters, respectively. Staffing firms reported no upward pressure on wages.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|11|District reports indicated that consumer spending increased modestly, on balance, during the reporting period. Kansas City reported that consumer spending strengthened, while retail sales rebounded in Richmond. Gains in retail sales were noted in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Boston reported that retailers' estimates of 2011 sales were generally more positive than they were at the beginning of October, while same-store sales in New York were mostly on or ahead of plan. Meanwhile, in Dallas, retail sales growth moderated, and Atlanta and St. Louis reported weaker activity. A few Districts noted that recent colder weather had spurred apparel sales. Inventory levels were generally at desired or comfortable levels in New York and Dallas. Retailers in Atlanta continued with tight inventory management practices, and retailers in Richmond were cautious regarding inventory and expansion. In Kansas City, inventories were above year-earlier levels. Holiday sales were generally expected to be flat or to increase modestly over a year ago in Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. In Philadelphia, high-end, online, and outlet retailers were the most optimistic for holiday sales, while retailers in Chicago expected to use extended promotional periods and heavy discounting to keep traffic volumes steady.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|11|Business service activity was flat to higher since the previous report. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported increased activity. St. Louis was mixed, while Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco indicated overall flat activity. Dallas reported that demand for staffing services held steady at high levels. St. Louis reported that firms in business support services, medical research services, and transportation services announced plans to expand operations and hire new workers, while contacts in temporary help services, government services, and education services announced plans to decrease operations. San Francisco noted that sales continued to grow for providers of technology services, in particular for software applications used for mobile computing and communication devices.
summary|Manufacturing|2011|11|activity grew at a steady pace across most of the country, with all Districts other than St. Louis reporting increases in orders, shipments, or production. Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported positive results in metals and fabrication, while Cleveland saw flat steel production and Philadelphia noted decreased demand for primary metals. Cleveland and Chicago reported increased auto production year over year, but Boston noted signs of slower auto component production. Dallas saw steady demand for electronics, computers, and high-technology goods, but San Francisco reported that demand for consumer electronics continued to decrease. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago saw increased production of energy-related products. For construction-related goods, Chicago and Minneapolis reported declining demand, while Dallas said demand was stable. Overall, St. Louis saw more plant closures than plant openings or expansions. Freight transportation volumes increased in Cleveland, held steady in Atlanta and Kansas City, and were mixed in Dallas.
summary|Banking and Finance|2011|11|Overall bank lending activity increased slightly since the previous report. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported increased loan demand. Several Districts reported an increase in home refinancing activity. Richmond reported mixed loan activity. Boston noted plentiful financing and favorable terms for premier properties, while financing remains harder to obtain for riskier properties and for those in secondary and tertiary markets. Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco noted relatively unchanged loans. Atlanta saw soft loan demand as companies continued to reduce their debt loads and limit expansion and capital improvement plans.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|11|Overall residential real estate activity increased, but conditions were varied across Districts. Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas noted increased activity. New York, Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported flat activity at relatively low levels. Atlanta and St. Louis indicated decreased sales. Residential construction remained sluggish. Single-family home construction remained weak, while multifamily construction picked up in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis. San Francisco remained "anemic," while St. Louis and Kansas City reported decreased activity.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|11|Districts mostly reported favorable agricultural conditions. Harvests were ahead of pace or completed in Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. The corn harvest was even with last year in Chicago and Minneapolis, while soybean production decreased. Wheat production was down dramatically in parts of the Minneapolis District. Corn and soybean yields were above average in the northern portions of the Kansas City District, but drought conditions severely cut crop production in the District's southern regions, and the winter wheat crops were in poor to fair condition. The severe drought in the Dallas District continued but eased slightly. Prices for most agricultural commodities except soybeans remained above year-earlier levels, and farm income increases were reported by Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Export demand remains strong for agricultural products, particularly meat, but Dallas reported a recent decrease in demand for grain exports.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|11|Hiring was generally subdued, but some firms with open positions reported difficulty finding qualified applicants. Stable employment levels or subdued hiring were mentioned by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Assessments of labor market conditions were mixed in Richmond and St. Louis, while labor markets showed some signs of reduced availability of labor in Minneapolis. In Boston, demand for workers at services firms grew, but hiring among manufacturers was limited. In Kansas City, hiring plans among manufacturers remained solid, while expectations of future hiring among manufacturers in Philadelphia nearly doubled. Meanwhile, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis noted that some firms looking to fill open positions were having difficulty finding qualified workers, particularly for high-skilled manufacturing and technical positions. Atlanta noted there was growing concern that the skills of the unemployed were deteriorating.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|11|District manufacturing activity was little changed in November. Our latest survey showed virtually no change in shipments and orders across firms, after having indicated declining activity over the past four months. A furniture manufacturer reported a slight firming of new orders, but noted that cancellations had increased. He added that the net change was small and that uncertainty about the economy was holding back demand. Similarly, a textile mill producer said that his company expanded production to a seven-day workweek in order to accommodate new orders. Unfortunately, they ran out of yarn and cut back to a five-day week until suppliers could catch up. An electrical component producer said that flooding in Thailand had lowered production. He added that his company will have serious trouble meeting his customers' orders during the next three-to-six months. Also, an electrical equipment manufacturer cited a significant slowdown in order intake due to uncertain global economic situations. He stated that firms were slowing the rate of their order placement. Raw material prices grew at a somewhat faster pace than a month ago, according to survey respondents, while prices for finished goods grew more slowly.
richmond|Retail|2011|11|sales rebounded in recent weeks, with apparel and department store sales leading the improvement. However, some retail and wholesale contacts remained cautious regarding inventory and expansion. A contact at a large pharmacy in South Carolina and a distributor to department stores both reported solid sales growth. Several auto dealers reported stronger sales. A jeweler in Charlotte, North Carolina remained guarded about the economy, and remarked that he is "only buying what is necessary." In addition, a large chain store for homebuilder supplies plans more expansion overseas than domestically.  prices rose at a somewhat faster pace since our last report.
richmond|Services|2011|11|Firms reported generally flat revenues since our last report, although a few contacts indicated that demand strengthened. A Baltimore contact noted that local unemployment had reduced the demand for daycare services, and several advertising firms and telecommunications-related businesses reported little change in demand. In contrast, revenues were up significantly for some restaurateurs in the Charlotte, North Carolina region. In addition, a central North Carolina hospital began to add a broad range of specialty physicians and associated staff, and other District healthcare facilities hired technical personnel to meet changing federal requirements for healthcare facilities. Non-retail services prices rose more rapidly in recent weeks.
richmond|Finance|2011|11|Loan demand in the District continued to be mixed. A major lender in the District reported that small business loans at his bank were improving, with much of the demand stemming from the need to expand production and upgrade office equipment and software. An official for a small bank cited a strengthening commercial loan pipeline, resulting from larger banks in his market area shedding customers. A banker who specializes in export financing noted an uptick in demand, but added that many small businesses were not able to meet the bank's lending standards. Several bankers noted continued strength in mortgage refinancing. However, few lenders were issuing new mortgages, and bottlenecks in the appraisal process were delaying closings. In contrast, a central Virginia banker described loan demand as relatively weak, with most applicants failing to meet qualification standards. And a banker on the Eastern Shore reported that loan demand remained weak, with "no demand for business expansion loans." Several bankers and small commercial contractors stated that getting approval for new construction loans was extremely difficult, due to tight credit standards and a poor outlook for profitability.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|11|Indicators of real estate activity around the District were mixed since our last report. Several Realtors reported that sales activity had increased somewhat but housing prices were about the same or down slightly from a month ago. Brokers in Richmond and Fredericksburg noted many showings but few resulting contracts. Sales in the low price range were generally reported as faring much better than sales in the upper ranges. However, a contact in northern Virginia stated that sales at the upper end of the price range were doing much better in his area. A Realtor in the D.C. area said that his inventory and new listings were down considerably. In addition, a homebuilder in the Carolinas said that existing home sales continued to fall, but added that new home sales were up in Charleston, SC, which he attributed to empty nesters relocating to that area. Also, a custom builder in southern Maryland described his business as enjoying the biggest improvement in demand that he had seen in three years.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|11|Assessments of labor market conditions were mixed since our last report. Several employment agencies reported average-to-somewhat-stronger demand for temporary workers in recent weeks, particularly in the information technology and manufacturing sectors. Finding skilled workers continued to be a major concern. A Virginia contact noted that skill shortages and unwillingness of candidates to move to his area were becoming an increasing problem for his firm. Similarly, a manufacturer in North Carolina stated that his company was "having a tough time hiring good people." He added that many workers would not accept a job because their unemployment benefits were too good. Another agent in North Carolina said mobility issues were a major concern because potential hires could not sell their homes. A builder in West Virginia was fearful that his area was losing critically skilled workers, who will be needed whenever the housing sector recovers. According to our latest survey, hiring was flat at services firms, and wage growth on average slowed. Retailers continued to shed employees, and average retail wages over the last month grew at about the same pace as in October. Hiring by manufacturers stabilized over the last month, while the average workweek was unchanged and wage growth strengthened.
richmond|Tourism|2011|11|Contacts generally reported slightly higher hotel bookings in recent weeks. A Myrtle Beach contact stated that higher hotel occupancy rates pushed up revenues, although the revenue gains remained below pre-recession highs. A contact in Annapolis, Maryland stated that local hotel bookings were up, but discounting was prevalent, and while the Annapolis Boat Show was well attended, sales there were light. A Virginia resort hotelier remarked that "the phones have been flooded, but people are still looking for the best deal."  remained solid in other areas as well. For example, a hotel manager at a resort in western Virginia noted that season ski passes were selling at about the same rate as a year ago. Reservations were already being made for other local winter recreational events, and the weeks surrounding Christmas were booked. Contacts at District tourist attractions indicated that attendance rose since our last report. Most contacts reported no change in room rates.
richmond|Agriculture|2011|11|Recent weather conditions allowed farmers to make steady progress in harvesting and small grain planting throughout most of the District. The corn harvest was nearing completion in Virginia and was winding down in Maryland, with farmers in those states saying that yields remained mostly good. The cotton harvest was getting into full swing in North Carolina and was ahead of schedule in South Carolina. In addition, the apple harvest was completed in Maryland and nearly completed in Virginia. Farmers in the District were harvesting their early soybean crop, which was reported to be in fair-to-good condition. Small grains had been planted and were off to a good start in much of the District.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|11|Consumer spending strengthened, and expectations improved for the months ahead. Retail sales continued to grow solidly, and the majority of contacts expected continued sales growth in coming months. Sales of apparel and seasonal outerwear were noted as particularly strong, while a few contacts characterized sales of high-end appliances and jewelry items as weak. Store inventories leveled out somewhat but were above year-ago levels in most establishments. Auto sales remained solid, with several dealers reporting high demand for mid-size SUVs and fuel efficient vehicles. Expectations for future auto sales were mostly positive, and auto inventories increased slightly over the previous survey. Restaurant sales improved, with further growth expected in coming months. Tourist activity was largely flat, but some contacts were cautiously optimistic about the upcoming winter season.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|11|District manufacturing activity edged higher from the previous survey, and expectations rebounded after easing somewhat the past few months. Factory orders slowed slightly, but shipments increased and hiring plans remained solid. Plant managers indicated moderate growth in capital spending plans. Transportation firms noted generally stable conditions, but expectations for future activity increased over the previous survey and capital spending plans were positive. The majority of high-tech services firms reported strong growth in sales and expected this trend to continue. Future capital expenditure plans at high-tech firms remained solid.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|11|Residential and commercial real estate activity remained generally sluggish in October and early November. Housing starts dropped from the previous survey, with construction of higher-priced homes particularly weak. Expectations for future homebuilding remained slow, and materials were generally available. Sales at residential construction supply firms improved somewhat, driven in part by an increase in remodeling as more consumers updated existing homes. Home sales picked up slightly but remained weak overall. Expectations for future home sales were more positive than in previous months, and home inventories drifted lower as home prices continued to ease in most areas. Mortgage lending activity was positive and remained above year-ago levels, though some contacts reported continued buyer financing difficulties. Commercial real estate activity edged higher from the previous survey, but remained sluggish overall with little further improvement expected. Vacancy rates dropped slightly, though they were expected to rise somewhat in future months. Office prices and rents increased but remained below year-ago levels, and expectations were flat. One contact in Joplin, Missouri noted considerable building activity as a result of the devastating tornado in that area last spring.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|11|Most bankers reported steady or stronger loan demand, stable or improving loan quality, and increased deposits compared with the previous survey. Overall loan demand increased marginally as demand for commercial and residential real estate loans strengthened, demand for consumer installment loans declined, and demand for commercial and industrial loans weakened slightly. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and deposits increased for the seventh straight survey. Bankers generally reported loan quality as steady or improving compared to a year ago, with even more improvement expected for the next six months.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|11|activity continued to expand strongly in October and early November. Nearly all contacts reported an increase in drilling activity and were optimistic about the months ahead. Crude oil prices remained favorable for drilling, and one contact noted that overall drilling activity was approaching levels reached before the price collapse in 2008. However, contacts reported that shortages of equipment and labor continued to constrain the rate of increase in exploration to some degree, and one producer said the delay in the Keystone Pipeline project was hindering future growth.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|11|Agricultural activity varied across the District in October and early November. Northern portions of the District, which received ample summer precipitation, reported above average corn and soybean yields at harvest and the majority of Nebraskas wheat crop emerged in good condition. In contrast, drought conditions severely cut crop production in the Districts southern regions, with Kansas and Oklahoma winter wheat crops in fair or poor condition. Robust export demand continued to boost crop and livestock prices. Farm income rose in areas with bumper harvests, while crop insurance was expected to mitigate losses in cases of poor yields or crop failure. Strong farm income boosted farm loan repayment rates and trimmed demand for operating loans. With rising farm income and strong demand from both farmers and non-farm investors, District farmland values posted another record high, with the strongest gains in the northern Plains.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|11|Price levels were generally stable, and wage pressures remained mostly contained, outside of a few skilled positions. Manufacturing price pressures moderated somewhat, especially for raw materials, and fewer firms planned to raise selling prices. Prices for construction materials stabilized, and retail prices were also flat as fewer firms expected increases. However, transportation firms reported continued high input prices, and restaurants expected higher menu prices due to rising food costs. Wage pressures were still contained in most industries. However, some firms reported difficulties finding skilled workers and were forced to raise wages, particularly in energy and information technology fields. Hiring plans were generally solid for most firms, particularly those in the energy, information technology, and manufacturing sectors.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2013|3|Price increases were limited for most items. Modest upward price pressure was reported for petroleum-related products such as gasoline, fertilizer, and plastics, and some technology products containing precious metal or rare earth components. Reports indicated that prices of some construction materials, including wood products, wallboard, drywall, and steel rebar edged up further, while roofing, cement, and aluminum prices dropped back slightly. Retail grocers reported relatively stable pricing overall, but weather-related factors boosted fresh produce prices in some regions. Hotel room rates increased in Las Vegas and Hawaii. Prices for professional services, such as legal and financial, were stable.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2013|3|Retail sales grew modestly on balance. The recent pace of sales and the near-term sales outlook were reported as fragile by retailers selling to consumers at the lower end of the income distribution. New automobile sales remained solid, driven by demand to replace older vehicles and low financing rates. Sales remained somewhat soft for traditional retail grocers, who experienced intensifying competition from discount and online retailers. Demand for higher-end clothing has been stable. Contacts also reported expansion in the user base for Internet and digital media products through increased sales of devices and enhanced features on a number of existing platforms.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2013|3|District manufacturing activity appeared to tick up during the reporting period of January through late-February. Production activity for commercial aircraft and parts expanded, although contacts projected weaker demand for defense aircraft. Longer-term bookings for electronic components appeared to increase. Pharmaceutical goods producers experienced modest gains. Contacts indicated high levels of demand for a clean alternative to diesel fuel that is under development. Wood product manufacturers reported that demand grew further, fueled in large part by rebounds in residential construction activity. Demand for steel products used primarily in infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects grew somewhat. While overall steel capacity utilization remained at a historically low level, capacity utilization was stronger in the automotive steel products subsector.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2013|3|Production activity and sales were strong for agricultural producers, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production expanded on net. Demand for most crop and livestock products grew further, and high grain prices contributed to elevated land prices. Agricultural producers faced higher petroleum-based fuel costs but lower natural gas costs. Natural gas inventories declined a bit. In some slower-growing regions, demand for new gas and electric hookups remains tepid. In parts of the District, warmer-than-average weather conditions led to reductions in overall energy usage. Raw materials were adequately available, although water availability beyond 2013 was a concern in some regions due to a dry winter.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2013|3|Demand for housing strengthened, and commercial real estate activity expanded, driven by pockets of strength in several locales. Home sales climbed further in most regional markets, and continuing low inventory levels supported stable or increasing prices. Construction of multifamily residential projects continued to expand.  Commercial real estate development and leasing activity increased, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle markets, fueled by sustained growth in the technology sector. Commercial rental rates increased in various parts of the District.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2013|3|Contacts from financial institutions reported that loan demand was up somewhat, and overall credit availability has either improved or remained unchanged from the last quarter of 2012. Contacts expect loan demand to increase more rapidly after federal spending uncertainty is alleviated. Banking contacts continued to highlight ample liquidity and generally stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to well-qualified business loan applicants, with community banks facing increasing competition for small business and auto lending. Contacts reported increases in privately held technology companies poised for public offerings; despite the positive outlook, recent initial public offering, venture capital, and private equity activity was relatively slow in the District's Internet and digital media subsectors. Reports indicated that credit quality for both business and consumer loans has continued to improve slowly.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2013|3|Retailers contacted in this round report overall fiscal year 2012 sales increases mostly ranging from 1 percent to 3 percent from 2011, with one source reporting a 7 percent year-over-year rise; these firms completed their 2012 fiscal years either at the end of December or in February. For January 2013, comparable-store sales ranged from a 1 percent decrease to a 6 percent increase from January 2012. Demand continues to be strong for clothing, home furnishings, and furniture, although a few contacts cite some softening in February which they attribute to consumer uncertainty regarding job creation, budget deficits, and the possible sequestration, as well as weather-related issues that depressed store traffic in certain areas. One contact notes that their customers often use tax refunds to finance durable good purchases, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 enacted on January 2, 2013 has caused some people to delay filing their returns. Respondents suggest it will be easier to discern underlying sales trends in another month or two. However, they continue to predict a low-growth economy and a somewhat wary consumer in 2013. Wholesale prices are reportedly holding steady.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2013|3|Manufacturing firms in the First District continue to paint a picture of a slow recovery. Of the 12 firms responding this round, six report higher sales in the fourth quarter versus the same period a year earlier, two report flat sales and four report lower sales. In contrast to the mixed sales picture, 10 of the 12 firms say that their outlook for 2013 is positive. Part of the disconnect reflects the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which accounts for two of the firms reporting both negative growth in the fourth quarter and positive expected growth in 2013. One firm in particular reports that sales were down by more than one-third in the fourth quarter but that orders are up almost 20 percent. Even some of our own contacts appear to be puzzled at the combination of poor sales results and optimism about growth for 2013; for example, one says his firm--at which January sales were down 6 percent year-on-year--wrote in planned sales growth of 4 percent to 8 percent in the second half "without any specific reason" except that "everyone expects sales to strengthen." A contact in the home improvement goods industry notes that sales were strong in the fourth quarter but cautions that tool sales lag increases in housing starts by 6 to 9 months so it is too soon to tell if the increase is seasonal or cyclical. A contact that supplies material for filtration says the global picture is difficult to pin down because Chinese New Year and the seasonal Christmas shutdowns in Europe made year-on-year comparison particularly difficult in recent months. Finally, several respondents expressed uncertainty regarding China, with one saying that some of his Chinese customers reported dramatic reductions in sales, inconsistent with government statistics.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2013|3|New England software and information technology services contacts generally report lackluster activity through February. Several contacts cite weaker-than-expected demand and delays in executing large license agreements, driven in part by economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe and Japan. By contrast, two contacts--whose firms have experienced robust growth since 2010--expanded accounts with a number of global insurance companies, bringing revenues in the fourth quarter to record highs. Many contacts continue to slow the pace at which they are hiring. Indeed, one contact shed approximately 150 jobs in the fourth quarter and has since instituted a "soft hiring freeze"; two other contacts now plan to maintain their current headcount through the end of 2013, following increases of over 5 percent in 2012. Selling prices and capital and technology spending have gone largely unchanged. The outlook among New England software and IT contacts is generally consistent with that of three months ago, with most expecting more robust growth in the second half of 2013.
boston|Staffing Services|2013|3|First District staffing contacts report that business continues to strengthen. Labor market activity since January is characterized as "improved" or "encouraging", with all but one contact registering a year- over-year increase in billable hours. The continued growth reportedly reflects increases in labor demand in the IT, industrial, and business services sectors partially offset by a softening of demand for office and clerical assistants and manufacturing personnel. The number of permanent and temporary-to-permanent placements continues to grow, with one contact reporting that permanent placements in their professional business, which includes IT and engineering, are up nearly 30 percent relative to a year ago. Labor supply has gone largely unchanged since May 2012. Contacts continue to have difficulty finding candidates with high-end skill sets such as mechanical and electrical engineers, software developers, and IT personnel; one respondent says this shortage of qualified labor is putting upward pressure on pay rates. Looking forward, staffing contacts are generally more upbeat than they were three months ago, with most expecting steady or accelerated growth in the second quarter.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2013|3|Contacts across the First District offer somewhat mixed reports concerning recent activity and the outlook, but note that fundamentals are largely unchanged since the last report. Leasing interest picked up slightly in Hartford in recent weeks but has not resulted in an increase in completed lease deals nor in significant absorption. In Boston, leasing inquiries remain steady. One Boston contact notes that tenants express little urgency to sign deals while another says that absorption increased slightly in recent weeks. In Providence, leasing activity picked up from last time and Class A downtown office vacancies fell to just under 9 percent from roughly 15 percent a year earlier. A Portland contact reports that leasing activity is stable and office rents unchanged since the last report, notwithstanding some newly announced plant closings in the region that will result in layoffs.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2013|3|Across New England, strong year-over-year sales growth continued in December in both single- family home and condominium markets. Initial sales figures for January suggest similarly robust year- over-year growth. According to contacts, low interest rates, affordable prices and improving economic conditions are all helping to spur buyer activity. Some contacts note, however, that a small increase in interest rates might actually spur potential homebuyers to purchase more quickly. Overall, realtors say they are confident in the strength of buyer demand, but worry that declining inventory could damp sales growth. In Greater Boston, realtors report that multiple bids on properties have become increasingly common as inventory falls. Declining inventory levels are putting upward pressure on prices in much of the region although the median sale price in New Hampshire slipped notwithstanding fewer listings.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|3|Consumer spending posted modest gains. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased 3 percent in January compared with a year ago. A Minnesota-based restaurant and bar chain reported 2 percent sales gains during January and early February compared with last year. A Minneapolis area mall manager noted that traffic was slower in January due to the cold weather, but winter apparel and jewelry sales have been strong. Store owners at a South Dakota mall noted that recent business appears to be doing well. An increase in inclement winter weather boosted business at auto body repair shops.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2013|3|Commercial construction activity increased at a robust pace since the last report. A real estate forecasting firm expects 600,000 square feet of industrial construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in 2013 compared with 200,000 square feet in 2012. Some of that construction is speculative. Residential construction increased rapidly from a year ago. The value of January residential building permits in Billings, Mont., more than doubled from last year, and the value of January permits in Sioux Falls, S.D., was up over 400 percent from a year ago, mainly due to apartment construction. In the Minneapolis- St. Paul area, January residential permits were up almost 70 percent compared with January 2012.
minneapolis|Services|2013|3|Activity at professional business services firms increased at a modest pace since the last report. Several financial planners noted an increase in business due to clients gaining employment. Some architects noted an increase in bidding activity. A freight trucking company noted a recent slight uptick in traffic primarily due to increased e-commerce traffic. However, mortgage refinancing brokers reported a decrease in activity.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2013|3|District manufacturers saw modest growth since the last report. A January survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas. The rate of increase was slower in Minnesota from the previous month, due mostly to weaker nondurable goods production. A vehicle plant in North Dakota saw faster-than-expected production increases, and it plans to renovate its facilities. Another vehicle maker in Minnesota also reported increased sales, but weakened its outlook for the coming year slightly. However, a structural steel producer in Montana is closing.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2013|3|Activity in the energy sector was mixed, while mining slowed. Oil and gas exploration increased in North Dakota and decreased in Montana since the last report, while production remained at historically high levels. Developers are considering building a large oilfield waste facility in western North Dakota. A Minnesota electricity producer recently closed one coal-fired plant and converted another to natural gas to meet expected future pollution control rules; the utility has also built more wind turbines in North Dakota. Tight corn supplies put pressure on ethanol producers; two plants in Minnesota and one in North Dakota have idled in the last year. Two potential new fracking sandmines were proposed in southeastern Minnesota. Minnesota iron ore production in 2012 exceeded levels from the previous year. However, production at the end of the year came in lower than earlier months, and some facilities are planning to slow production in 2013.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2013|3|Agricultural producers in the District remained in mostly strong condition. Despite the drought, the USDA reported that 2012 corn production broke records in Minnesota and North Dakota. South Dakota corn and soybean production were down from the previous year, but came in higher than earlier estimates. The Minnesota sugar beet and North Dakota soybean crops were the highest on record. Prices received by farmers in January increased from a year earlier for wheat, corn, soybeans, cattle, milk, eggs and poultry; prices for hogs, turkey and dry beans were below their year-earlier levels.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages and Prices|2013|3|Labor markets tightened modestly since the last report. Representatives from two technology companies in Minnesota described the labor market for high-tech workers as "at full employment" with fewer qualified applicants applying for open positions. A trucking broker recently announced plans to expand in Minnesota and add 500 more staff over the next several years. A regional airline announced plans to relocate its headquarters to Minnesota, which will bring a few hundred jobs to the state. In North Dakota, an insurance company recently announced that it expects to create 200 new jobs. In contrast, a home mortgage operation in Minnesota will close this spring, affecting over 200 employees. A medical device company recently announced plans to lay off a substantial number of workers in Minnesota. In Montana, the closure of two food distribution warehouses will lead to over 100 job losses.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2013|3|Reports from District factories indicated that new orders and production were steady or up slightly during the past six weeks. Companies seeing increases were largely suppliers to the energy, residential construction, and transportation industries. Defense contractors cited concerns about the potential downside effects of sequestration. Compared to a year ago, production activity was mixed. Steel producers and service centers described shipping volume as slightly higher since the start of 2013 relative to the previous quarter. Many manufacturing contacts are somewhat more optimistic about near-term growth prospects than they were late in the fourth quarter. Auto production at District plants increased along seasonal trends during January on a month-over-month basis. Compared to a year ago, production was moderately lower, especially for domestic makers.
cleveland|Real Estate|2013|3|Home builders reported that the upturn in sales of new single-family homes continued into January, and that sales were significantly higher than a year-ago. Contracts were found mainly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories. Demand for multifamily housing remains strong, particularly in urban areas, and the turnover rate for apartments has been trending lower. While builders expressed confidence that the improvement in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months, they still see the appraisal process and the availability of financing as headwinds to more robust growth. List prices of new homes are increasing, which was attributed to shrinking inventories and rising construction costs. Builders have cut back on discounting.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2013|3|Many retailers we spoke with reported that January sales fell below year-ago levels. Higher taxes were cited as a potential contributing factor. Nonetheless, some of these contacts described January results as good or strong. We heard one report that high-end and lower-cost brands were doing better than products aimed at middle-income consumers. Increased volume was seen in apparel and firearms. Most of our contacts anticipate that transactions in the upcoming months will be above year-ago levels, in the low to mid-single digits. However, there is concern about the impact of rising gasoline prices on spending by lower-income households. Vendor and shelf prices held steady. Inventories rose slightly, but they were described as manageable. Capital expenditures were on plan for the fiscal year. No hiring is anticipated, except for staffing new stores.
cleveland|Banking|2013|3|Demand for business credit was little changed across sectors and product categories since our last report. A few large banks noted a slowdown in loan applications during January, while community bankers saw a rise in demand for commercial real estate loans. Reports on consumer credit also indicated little change in demand. Credit card balances were coming down, while activity in home-equity products and auto lending picked up. The residential mortgage market was characterized as strong; however, some of our contacts cited a decline in the number of applicants from a year ago. Delinquency rates held steady or declined across consumer and commercial loan categories. Aggregate core deposits grew, but there was a slight drop-off in business and public-sector deposits. Bankers remain very concerned about shrinking net interest margins. In response, they are considering broad-based cost-control initiatives, which include layoffs.
cleveland|Energy|2013|3|Coal production declined across the District relative to 2012 levels, with the largest decreases seen in northern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky. The downward trend in production is expected to continue in the near term. Falling prices for metallurgical coal leveled off, while steam-coal prices were mixed. Conventional oil and natural gas production was steady during the past couple of months, with little change expected during the next quarter. In contrast, shale gas activity expanded at a robust pace. Well-head prices have stabilized. Capital spending in the conventional oil and gas industry is expected to remain low until drilling picks up in late spring or summer. One contact said that he will drill fewer wells this year due to credit restrictions. Coal producers have cut back on capital expenditures. Production equipment and material prices were flat across most categories. Shale gas producers expanded payrolls, while employment at conventional oil and gas firms was flat. We heard several reports of layoffs by coal operators. Many of our contacts pointed to rising health insurance premiums as a concern.
cleveland|Freight Transportation|2013|3|For the most part, our contacts reported that shipping volume met or exceeded projections made late in 2012. Higher volume was attributed to stronger demand from the energy sector, rerouting of container traffic, and some residual effects of Hurricane Sandy. Freight executives were fairly positive in their outlook for 2013, but they were uncertain whether the boost in activity seen during a traditionally slow part of the shipping season is sustainable. Diesel fuel prices rose, which some carriers passed through via surcharges. Costs associated with equipment and maintenance items were stable. Reports on capital spending were mixed. Some freight haulers have increased budgets significantly for new equipment this year. Others are postponing equipment replacement until they are certain that the economy is on solid footing. Hiring is primarily for replacement. Wage pressures are surfacing due to difficulty in finding and keeping qualified drivers. There were a few reports about a potential driver shortage during the summer.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|3|District merchants noted a slight negative effect on consumer spending from the resumption of the full Social Security tax. Reports also indicated that expectations of higher healthcare costs and gasoline prices have contributed to a modest decline in consumer confidence. However, reports showed that sales were up on a year-over-year basis at chain stores. Discounts continued to bolster consumer activity, and auto dealers continued to cite strong sales growth.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2013|3|According to District brokers, sales growth moderated somewhat on a year-over-year basis but the majority reported that sales were ahead of year earlier levels. Existing home inventories continued to contract and several brokers reported that this was constraining sales. Many noted that properties were receiving multiple offers, particularly at the low-end of the market. Home prices were reported to be ahead of the year earlier level and spring home sales are expected to exceed the year earlier level, as well.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2013|3|Reports from businesses indicated that manufacturing in the region improved in January and early February. Contacts cited the highest activity level since last September. All components of the Southeast Purchasing Managers' Index experienced increases with new orders, production, and employment reflecting particular strength. The number of purchasing managers that expect production to be higher in the next three to six months increased compared with the end of last year.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2013|3|Bankers reported that mortgage loan demand was good, but continued to be largely driven by refinancing. However, some bankers expect the refinance market to ease up by mid-year as regulatory changes related to reselling mortgages on the secondary market becomes more stringent. Many indicated the willingness to lend, but some noted that competitors were offering loans at terms perceived as risky in the long run. Institutions were noted as having the capacity to handle increased loan volumes, but some continued to be conservative. Auto loan activity remained strong.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2013|3|Since the last report, employment growth for the District has been moderate. High-end retailers reported increased sales that have translated into mild increases in staffing levels. Real estate contacts said they have yet to experience gains that would warrant increasing their staffing levels significantly. Similarly, community bankers noted increased optimism on the real estate front, but are restricting employment levels because of uncertainty related to upcoming regulatory change. On balance, firms providing accounting and consulting services to healthcare providers reported much-increased demand because of regulatory changes, resulting in shortages of compliance specialists.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2013|3|As domestically produced oil has become increasingly available, Gulf Coast refiners reported declining dependence on imported crude for processing, and more refined product being exported. There was some concern that oil and petroleum product export capacity at Gulf of Mexico ports was becoming strained; however, contacts noted that planned investments at these ports were likely to increase export capacity going forward.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2013|3|Retailers report that sales were strong in January but mixed in early February. Contacts in upstate New York report that sales, as well as traffic, were strong in January but slowed somewhat during the first half of February, in part, because of bad weather in the early part of the month. Moreover, contacts report that the mix of sales activity has continued to shift from actual mall sales to Internet sales. One retail contact notes that deep discounting is becoming increasingly common
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2013|3|Residential real estate markets in the District have shown signs of improvement in recent weeks. A major appraisal firm reports that New York City's co-op and condo market has remained surprisingly active in early 2013, following an exceptionally strong fourth quarter. Apartment sales are up strongly from a year ago, and tight inventories are starting to nudge up prices across the board. One contact notes that year-end inventory levels were the lowest he has seen in more than 12 years. The apartment rental market, however, has leveled off; after rising at a roughly 5-10 percent rate in 2012, rents on apartments in both Manhattan and the outer boroughs are estimated to be running just 1-2 percent ahead of a year ago in early 2013.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2013|3|Non-manufacturing contacts report little change in business conditions overall, though they have grown increasingly optimistic about prospects for 2013. Contacts in the manufacturing sector report a pickup in activity since the start of the year and are increasingly optimistic about the near- term outlook.  A trucking industry analyst reports that truck tonnage (shipments) strengthened substantially in both December and January, after adjusting for seasonal variation.  In general, business contacts note some increase in input price pressures but relatively few say they are increasing their own selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2013|3|Small- to medium-sized banks report steady demand for consumer loans but increased demand for all other categories of loans; demand for refinancing was unchanged. Bankers report that credit standards were unchanged across all loan categories. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly in residential mortgages, where 40 percent of bankers indicate lower spreads and none indicates higher spreads. Most also indicate a decrease in the average deposit rate. Finally, banks report decreased delinquency rates on commercial and industrial loans and especially on commercial mortgages but indicate no change for residential mortgages and consumer loans.
chicago|Consumer spending|2013|3|increased at a slower rate in January and February. Retailers pointed to the negative impacts on household budgets from rising gas prices and the end of the payroll tax holiday as explanations for the slower pace of retail sales. Sales of clothing, furniture, and health and personal care items were weaker. However, gift card redemptions boosted sales of electronics, appliances, music, and sporting goods. Grocery stores also reported a slight increase in sales, while restaurant sales were flat. Auto sales were steady for much of the reporting period before increasing slightly over the last few weeks. Car and truck sales both improved, with all-wheel vehicles registering the largest gains. Severe winter weather conditions also led to an increase in service department activity. Looking ahead, retailers expressed concern that potential fiscal policy tightening would continue to have a negative impact on consumer sentiment and retail sales throughout the remainder of the first quarter.
chicago|Business spending|2013|3|Growth in business spending slowed in January and February. Inventory investment declined, and spending on equipment and structures was again limited. Several manufacturers noted that they plan to make capital expenditures this year only as necessary, delaying investments because of heightened uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy. Those non- manufacturing contacts that reported increased capital expenditures were primarily spending on additional vehicles and information technology. Labor market conditions were little changed. Hiring continued to increase slowly. Contacts indicated that there is still strong demand for talent in skilled professional and manufacturing jobs. However, several manufacturing contacts expressed plans to either invest in more productive capital equipment or adjust the hours of existing employees before hiring new workers this year. In addition, a staffing firm noted that demand for temporary employees had improved--largely based on an increase in demand from the manufacturing sector--but remained weaker in the District than for the rest of the nation.
chicago|Construction/real estate|2013|3|Construction and real estate activity was again mixed in January and February. Demand for residential construction continued to increase slowly, buoyed by ongoing strength in multifamily construction. A contact noted that some builders are in the early stages of looking for new land to develop. Even so, many builders and lenders remain very cautious to re- enter the single-family market. Conditions in the residential real estate market improved slightly, with home prices edging higher and the inventory of unsold homes declining. Home sales reportedly picked up in wealthier communities, but sales continued to lag in low and moderate- income communities. Although there was some modest growth in nonresidential construction, the level of activity remains weak. Notably, while some new projects are slated to break ground, growth in commercial and office space is expected to remain below trend for some time. However, contacts did note that construction of private-practice facilities close to affiliated hospitals is an area of strength in this segment. Commercial real estate leasing activity was generally unchanged--rents held steady, while vacancy rates continued to come down slowly. In contrast, some manufacturers were reportedly leasing temporary space in order to accommodate increased demand.
chicago|Manufacturing|2013|3|Growth in manufacturing production picked up in January and February. The auto industry remained a source of strength, with light vehicle sales expected to increase throughout the year. Specialty metal manufacturers reported increases in new orders and order backlogs; but many expressed concern about the increased volatility of their customers' orders, citing heightened uncertainty over the regulatory and fiscal environment. Inventories at steel service centers were noted to be below desirable levels. A steel producer stated that the steel market is currently moving sideways, but sees signs that activity will pick up later in the year. Manufacturers of household goods also reported a pick-up in demand as the housing market continued to improve. However, a manufacturer of building materials noted that demand had slowed some for their product since the end of last year. Demand for heavy equipment also weakened, with lower coal prices contributing to less mining activity. Furthermore, contacts indicated that heavy equipment dealers were working through an excess inventory of construction equipment. The recent weakness is expected to be temporary, with demand projected to rebound in the second half of the year.
chicago|Banking/finance|2013|3|Credit conditions continued to ease over the reporting period. Credit spreads and financial market volatility remained low and asset quality continued to improve. While underlying risk free rates have risen since the last reporting period, competition among lenders and investor willingness to accept more risk prevented an increase in private borrowing rates. Banking contacts reported moderate growth in business and consumer loan demand, with pricing relatively unchanged but some loosening of loan standards. Residential real estate lending, in particular, continued to benefit from historically low interest rates. Contacts noted banks are keeping few very mortgage originations on their balance sheet and relying on interest rate swaps to hedge against a potential rise in interest rates.
chicago|Prices/costs|2013|3|Cost pressures were moderately higher in January and February. Contacts noted some upward pressure on raw materials prices, particularly for lumber, drywall, steel, aluminum, and copper. Several also cited rising energy and transportation costs, pointing to higher gasoline and natural gas prices. Retailers reported modest wholesale price increases for a number of products and larger price increases for meat, fresh produce, and leather. Pass-through to downstream prices, however, was limited. Wage pressures remained moderate. Costs for healthcare and other benefits continued to increase; some contacts noted that they were passing along the higher costs to employees. More generally, higher compensation costs were not being passed on to customers.
chicago|Agriculture|2013|3|Snow and rain continued to boost topsoil moisture levels, although depleted subsurface moisture remained a concern for farmers. Between engineering work on the Mississippi River, higher water levels, and low export demand for grain, congestion eased for barge activity. Corn and soybean stocks at grain elevators were even tighter than last year, as many farmers continued to store a share of their crops on hand in anticipation of higher profits closer to harvest this year. Input costs for planting have not changed substantially over the winter. Corn, wheat, milk, hog, and cattle prices dipped during the reporting period, while soybean prices moved a little higher. The prices for corn and soybeans in February become the benchmarks for potential compensation from crop revenue insurance plans; these prices were high enough to guarantee that insured crop operations will cover their production costs this year. Lower feed costs aided the cash flows of livestock operations. Lower corn prices also led to higher ethanol production.
dallas|Prices|2013|3|Most responding firms noted stable prices, although some transportation service contacts said costs were up due to higher fuel prices. High tech contacts noted downward pressure on prices, particularly for memory devices.
dallas|Labor Market|2013|3|Employment held steady or increased at most firms. Accounting firms said the pace of hiring picked up temporarily as firms entered the busy tax season, but that long-term hiring remained moderate. Legal firms said employment increased, and some noted robust hiring activity for experienced corporate, energy and intellectual property lawyers. One respondent in the staffing industry noted a tight market for skilled workers.
dallas|Manufacturing|2013|3|Construction-related manufacturers' reports were mixed. Lumber producers noted slow seasonal demand, while sales of cement and related products continued to increase due to solid residential building activity. Outlooks were generally more optimistic than the last report. Demand for fabricated metals rose sharply over the reporting period due to an increase in new private projects. Overall, primary metals producers noted slow seasonal demand, but one contact said they had recently been awarded a large project which would keep them busy for the next three months.
dallas|Retail Sales|2013|3|Retail sales were flat to up slightly since the last report. According to two national retailers, Texas continued to outperform the nation, albeit by a small margin. Inventories were at desired levels. Outlooks were optimistic, with contacts expecting steady improvement through the first quarter and low- to mid-single digit increases in 2013 over 2012.
dallas|Nonfinancial Services|2013|3|Reports from staffing firms were mixed. One contact noted sharp declines in demand for services across the board, while another reported stellar demand that broke direct- hiring records. Outlooks were cautious. Some contacts noted concern that client companies are hiring the absolute minimum to get by due to uncertainty about the Affordable Care Act.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2013|3|Contacts in the single-family housing sector said new and existing home demand remained strong since the last report. Realtors noted that extremely low inventories were leading to price increases. Apartment demand growth continues to ease from last year, but contacts remain optimistic, expecting occupancies to remain high despite new construction.
dallas|Financial Services|2013|3|Financial institutions reported mixed loan demand. Larger institutions noted flat loan demand, while community banks reported moderate loan growth. Consumer lending activity increased modestly, while real estate loan demand was limited. Energy activity in the Eagle Ford shale continued to drive lending activity in San Antonio, Houston and the surrounding areas. Loan pricing remained very competitive. Loan quality continued to improve, and borrowers were paying off their loans ahead of schedule. Deposits and deposit rates were flat to slightly down. Outlooks were unchanged, but there is some optimism among contacts that loan demand will increase slightly in the near term.
dallas|Energy|2013|3|Activity remained at high levels, and respondents at energy-related service firms noted that the number of active drilling rigs seems to have bottomed out. Margins for services particularly pressure pumping remained tight, but contacts reported slight easing in pricing pressures. Contacts said expectations for average drilling activity in 2013 are being revised up, with most of the improvement expected to occur in the second half of the year.
dallas|Agriculture|2013|3|The drought was the main concern over the reporting period. Feed costs remained high and cattle supplies were tight because of the drought, while beef prices and demand both declined seasonally. Cotton prices rallied since the last report, and cotton exports were up slightly. In contrast, corn and grain sorghum prices declined modestly over the reporting period. Grain exports were lower than expected.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2013|3|Contacts reported that retail sales in the past three months were up, on average, relative to the same period last year. Fifty percent of contacts noted increases in sales, while 25 percent noted decreases and the rest saw no changes. Sixty-three percent of retailers reported that sales levels met their expectations, and the remaining retailers reported that sales fell short of expectations. About 69 percent of retailers noted that their inventories were at desired levels, while the remaining contacts reported that their inventory levels were too high. The sales outlook over the next three months was positive: 63 percent of retailers expect sales to increase over 2012 levels, while 19 percent expect sales to decrease.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|3|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our previous report. Several manufacturing firms reported plans to add workers and expand operations in the Eighth District, while fewer manufacturers reported plans to lay off workers or reduce operations. Firms in steel, automobile, appliance, furniture, automobile parts, plastics, wood products, lumber, beverage, and machinery manufacturing industries announced plans to hire new employees and expand operations in the near future.  In  contrast,  firms  that  manufacture  solar  equipment,  medical  devices,  food,  and  electric components announced plans to lay off workers.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2013|3|Home sales continued to increase throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2012, January 2013 year-to-date home sales were up 19 percent in Louisville, 23 percent in Little Rock, 11 percent in Memphis, and 23 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction also increased in most of the District. Compared with the same period in 2012, January 2013 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased 19 percent in Louisville, 9 percent in Memphis, and 44 percent in St. Louis. In contrast, permits decreased 1 percent in Little Rock over the same period.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2013|3|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks found little change in overall lending activity during the fourth quarter of 2012. During this period, credit standards and demand for commercial and industrial loans remained largely unchanged. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans ranged from basically unchanged to eased somewhat, while demand ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger.  Credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans remained generally unchanged, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to moderately stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards and demand for consumer loans remained largely unchanged.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|3|Annual crop production in the District's states declined for most crops in 2012. The District's states produced less corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat in 2012 compared with 2011; in contrast, the District's states produced more rice and sorghum. The effect of the decline in production on farm incomes was partially offset by higher prices in the District's states for corn, rice, sorghum, and soybeans. January coal production in the District's states (excluding eastern Kentucky) was down 3.6 percent relative to a year ago.
st_louis|Prices, Wages, and Employment|2013|3|Sixty-one percent of contacts indicated that price levels over the past three months have stayed the same, while 25 percent indicated that prices have increased relative to the same period last year. Similarly, half of contacts noted that non-labor costs over the past three months have stayed the same, while 48 percent of contacts noted that non-labor costs have increased. Forty-three percent of contacts, in turn, noted that wages over the past three months have stayed the same, while 57 percent noted that wages have increased relative to the same period last year. Meanwhile, 54 percent of contacts reported that employment levels have remained the same over the past three months, while 35 percent reported that employment levels have increased, compared with the same period last year.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2013|3|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported that orders and shipments dipped slightly. Some of the current weakness was attributed to greater volatility in production swings associated with overall slow growth, a high level of uncertainty, and a reluctance to build inventories. As one contact said, "Who can plan?" Makers of food products, lumber and wood products, industrial machinery, electronic equipment, and instruments have reported gains since the last Beige Book. Lower activity was reported by the makers of primary metals and fabricated metal products. Contacts have attributed some growth to rising demand from sectors related to autos, housing, Marcellus shale, and other energy production.
philadelphia|Retail|2013|3|Third District retailers reported a faster pace of sales in January than during the recent holiday period and cited continued gains in February for moderate growth overall. The stronger sales were evident throughout the region and across a variety of malls and outlet centers, regardless of the level of the stores' quality. Contacts cited a return of cold weather and heavy promotions as prompting double-digit apparel sales of winter wear. Three other factors cited as contributing to the stronger growth were that sales may have borrowed from the soft ending to the holiday season, gift cards were more prevalent, and the comparison period one year ago had weak sales. Reports on leasing activity noted that retail tenants are more confident and taking longer lease terms, leading to net positive absorption, greater occupancy rates, and more landlord pricing power.
philadelphia|Finance|2013|3|Overall, loan volumes have continued to grow at a slight pace across Third District financial firms since the previous Beige Book. Most loan categories have grown little or not at all, with somewhat more activity generated for small business lending and home mortgages, especially refinancings. Consumer lending is relatively flat. In areas with Marcellus shale gas, several banks have described customers paying down loans with royalty money and avoiding further debt by paying cash. Beyond the gas fields, energy projects are attracting substantial investment interest and loan opportunities for larger banks. The majority of bank indicates little change in credit standards and slow, steady gains in quality; however, a small, but growing number expressed concern about competitors' standards. Financial institutions are generally optimistic about future growth, although most expect mergers and acquisitions to reduce the number of small community banks over the next few years.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2013|3|Homebuilders reported contract activity at or near plan for January with a pickup in traffic for February. Year-over-year growth rates were strong off of low levels and builders attributed part of their growth to capturing greater market share. Prospects have greater confidence and are more prepared to buy, including entry-level purchasers that had been increasingly opting to rent since mid-summer. Residential brokers reported moderate year-over-year sales growth in January for a second consecutive year; mild weather helped this year, although January 2012 was also noted for its extremely warm temperatures and lack of snow. As with new home construction, existing home sales are growing from a low base. Builders and brokers are optimistic for sustained growth through 2013. According to one broker, "Better times are coming."
philadelphia|ervices|2013|3|S  Third District service-sector firms have maintained a modest pace of growth since the last Beige Book, according to contacts in various sectors. Tourist activity has shifted to the Poconos' ski resorts, which are enjoying generous snowfalls and accommodating temperatures that already promise an extended season. However, contacts blame Hurricane Sandy for creating yet another economic casualty--the Poconos' peak ski week. Many school districts in New Jersey and New York canceled their winter break during the week of Presidents' Day to make up school days lost to the superstorm--causing many families to skip their traditional family ski vacation in the Poconos. Atlantic City casino revenues continued to struggle through January, prompting a recently-opened casino to file for bankruptcy protection while it continues to operate.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2013|3|Overall, price levels continued to increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Cost factors among manufacturing firms moderated a little, while the prices they received fell slightly. Tight auto inventories maintain a price environment that slightly favors auto dealers over their customers. Homebuilders continued to note higher prices for lumber, drywall, and other manufactured inputs. Some slight wage pressure is appearing for contractors, which may be related to increasing construction activity, but may also be due to repair crews being drawn to the Jersey Shore by short-term, higher wage contracts. Real estate contacts continued to report that low-end house prices are firm or rising slightly, while high-end home prices are still falling in most markets. Contacts from most sectors continued to report that wages rose only a little, if at all. Health insurance costs are mixed, ranging from very high increases to no change.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|3|Consumer spending expanded in most Districts, but several Districts reported mixed or lower activity among non-auto retailers. Sales strengthened in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, and retail sales were higher than a year ago in the Boston, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. San Francisco reported modest growth in sales, Dallas noted flat to slightly higher sales activity, and New York said retail sales were strong in January but slowed in February primarily due to weather. The Chicago District said consumer spending increased at a slower rate, while Cleveland and Atlanta noted mixed sales activity. Kansas City said retail sales decreased since the previous survey period and were expected to remain flat in the months ahead. Many District contacts commented on the expired payroll tax holiday and the Affordable Care Act as having restrained sales growth. Many Districts noted rising gasoline prices and fiscal policy as having a negative effect on consumer sales, and contacts in the Boston, New York, and Minneapolis Districts said severe weather depressed sales somewhat. Contacts in several Districts reported a shift in sales activity from local malls to the Internet and indicated deep discounting among retailers was becoming increasingly common. San Francisco noted somewhat soft sales for traditional retail grocers, whose competition has increased from discount and online retailers.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2013|3|Nonfinancial services activity continued to grow at a modest pace since the previous Beige Book. St. Louis and San Francisco reported strong demand for technology, logistics, marketing and legal services. Logistics services were also an area of growth in the Philadelphia District, but growth was modest due to firms' concerns about possible federal spending cuts. High-tech services increased in the Kansas City District, but growth was lackluster in the Boston District due in part to weak demand from Europe and Japan. Staffing services firms in the Boston and New York Districts saw improved conditions, but activity was mixed in the Dallas District. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City services contacts continued to be optimistic about growth in the coming months and in the second half of 2013.
summary|Manufacturing|2013|3|conditions improved in nearly all Districts, but the increases were generally modest. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco reported some increases in factory activity, but the majority noted that the pace of recovery was slow. Conditions were mixed in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, and manufacturing activity in the Kansas City District weakened. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts cited concerns over government regulation and fiscal uncertainty as a reason for slow growth.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2013|3|Residential real estate activity continued to strengthen in most Districts, although the pace of growth varied. Contacts in the Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted strong growth in home sales, while New York and Chicago reported slight improvements. A realtor in the Richmond District indicated that low interest rates continued to motivate home buyers, and potential buyers in the Philadelphia District expressed greater confidence, including entry-level purchasers who had been increasingly opting to rent since mid-summer. Contacts in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts said sales were higher than a year ago. Home construction increased in most Districts, with the exception of the Kansas City District where it was reported as unchanged. Several Districts noted ongoing strength in multifamily construction, although contacts in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts mentioned continued financing difficulties for builders. Home prices edged higher in the majority of Districts, with lower inventories generally cited as the primary cause. Richmond and Atlanta Realtors observed multiple offers on many homes. Philadelphia real estate contacts continued to report low-end home prices as firm or rising slightly, while high-end home prices were still falling. Inventories declined in nearly all Districts, with Realtors in several Districts concerned about the impact on future sales volume.
summary|Banking and Finance|2013|3|Loan demand was steady or increased across all the Districts that reported. Residential real estate loan demand was strong in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Chicago Districts, mainly driven by refinances due to continued low interest rates. Demand for commercial real estate loans was also strong in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts. Auto lending increased in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, and Philadelphia and Dallas cited growth in energy-related loan demand. San Francisco continued to report a slowdown in venture capital and private equity activity, but contacts noted an increase in the number of private technology companies moving toward an IPO.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|3|Agricultural conditions across the country varied with weather patterns. Persistent drought contributed to poor crop and pasture conditions in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts while recent precipitation improved soil moisture levels in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported that elevated crop prices supported stronger farm incomes. Kansas City and Dallas indicated that drought-related herd reductions pushed cattle supplies to historical lows, and Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas reported weaker agricultural export activity. Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted additional farmland value gains due to robust demand from both farmers and nonfarm investors. Chicago reported that congestion issues in barge traffic eased on the Mississippi River.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|3|Labor market conditions generally improved, although several Districts reported restrained hiring. Many Districts reported a rise in temporary employees, while staffing contacts in the Boston District noted an increase in the placement of permanent and temporary-to- permanent workers. Auto dealers in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts mentioned plans to hire more workers, and Dallas noted robust hiring activity for experienced corporate, energy, and intellectual property lawyers. Positions in the manufacturing industry increased in the New York, Richmond, and Chicago Districts, although several Chicago manufacturers expressed plans to either invest in more productive capital or adjust the hours of existing employees prior to hiring new workers. St. Louis noted weakness in healthcare services and information technology positions, and Cleveland reported reduced hiring plans from commercial builders and coal operators. Employers in several Districts cited the unknown effects of the Affordable Care Actas reasons for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire more staff. Wage pressures were minimal in most Districts, but contacts reported some upward pressure for several skilled positions as a result of higher demand. Some Districts indicated a shortage of skilled workers such as engineers, truck drivers, software developers, and technical jobs, and Atlanta noted a lack of compliance specialists due to heavier regulations in the healthcare industry.
richmond|Manufacturing|2013|3|Fifth District manufacturing activity showed some signs of strengthening. A producer of lumber products reported that the month of January was the best in more than five years, and a furniture manufacturer said that there was a firmer tone at his company as measured by product quotation requests. A manufacturer of polyester film told us that overall demand had increased, but he could not yet raise prices and margins continued to be squeezed. He noted that customers were not making long-term commitments and they continued to worry the sustainability of the positive economic trend. A textile manufacturer noted that uncertainty around his government-related contracts could lead to layoffs, although his non-government business was strong. According to our latest survey, raw materials prices grew at a slightly slower pace, while finished goods prices were little changed.
richmond|Ports|2013|3|District port administrators reported strong container traffic in recent weeks. Exports of agricultural and chemical products coming from the Gulf states and the Midwest rose, and port administrators expected a general pick-up in activity in March. Automobile imports slowed in January and February after finishing 2012 on a high note. Exports have led imports so far this year, although exports of equipment for construction and agriculture slowed as last year's capital restocking abated. The Chinese New Year on February 10 resulted in only a few port of call cancellations because of plant and port shutdowns in China. After months of extensions, concerns about dockworker contract negotiations generally lessened since early February, although contracts have not yet been finalized.
richmond|Retail|2013|3|sales strengthened in recent weeks. Survey respondents in food sales, pharmaceuticals, and home and garden centers reported higher revenues in February. A building supply wholesaler commented, "Things are on the mend." Sales of automobiles and light trucks remained strong, even as the pace slowed slightly from last year's robust levels, according to dealerships in several locations. An auto dealer in West Virginia described sales as "plugging along." Growth in retail prices slowed since our last report.
richmond|Services|2013|3|Activity in the service sector grew at a slower pace in this reporting period. Survey respondents at law firms, marketing firms, and nursing homes reported slower growth. In addition, executives we contacted at freight trucking firms reported little change in new demand in January and February, with increased business attributed to gaining a larger market share. Financial services firms also noted little change, although a broker at a Virginia firm remarked that his clients were feeling a bit more optimistic. Prices in the sector rose slightly faster.
richmond|Finance|2013|3|Lending activity increased marginally since our last report. Most bankers reported a slight uptick in demand for commercial and residential mortgages. Refinancing constituted a significant portion of this demand, primarily due to low interest rates. Officials from both a large commercial bank and a small community bank noted that the demand for refinancing also was driven by five year balloon payments coming due. In contrast, a North Carolina banker reported a slowdown in refinancing due to an increase in interest rates. Commercial loans rose modestly, although demand remained weak. Several bankers in West Virginia noted that there has been a reluctance to invest due to uncertainty about federal policies. A contact noted, "the best customers are not borrowing and are very liquid." However, other District bankers were cautiously optimistic about the future and growth in their loan portfolios. In addition, lenders noted minor improvement in credit quality and delinquency rates. On the consumer side, demand for loans remained flat. Bankers remarked that competition was increasingly aggressive.
richmond|Real Estate|2013|3|Residential real estate activity generally grew at a moderate pace since our last report. A contact in North Carolina stated that the housing recovery "is real, although modest at this point." He cited firming sales of new and existing single-family homes, falling inventories, and recovering resale prices as signs of improvement. A Realtor in the Washington, D.C. area said that continuing low interest rates coupled with decreasing inventory had created a very competitive market, which often led to multiple offers. Similarly, a Realtor in the metro-Richmond area indicated that low interest rates continued to motivate home buyers, and that many areas around Richmond had less than two months of supply. In Charleston, South Carolina, a Realtor told us that the housing market had regained some stability and that in 2012, for the first time in five years, more than 10,000 homes were sold. In contrast, a contact in the Charlotte area mentioned that people were adding rooms to their homes, rather than buying and moving. He noted that in the past, homeowners chose renovation projects based on the expected effect on the market price. Now, he said, they build for themselves and stay put. In Maryland, a source reported slow recovery in the housing sector with fewer days on the market and added that housing prices had stabilized.
richmond|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|3|The agricultural sector remained strong, while energy production declined slightly. Results of our most recent agricultural survey indicated that farmland values were above both the previous quarter and year-ago levels. In addition, most contacts noted that 2012 was one of the best years that farmers have ever had; they indicated that higher commodity prices had resulted in stronger cash positions. Several forestry contacts reported a pickup in lumber prices due to the uptick in the housing sector.
richmond|Labor Markets|2013|3|Labor market activity was little changed since our last report. Hiring remained flat across most sectors, although there were some exceptions. Employers across the District continued to cite the Affordable Care Act and its unknown impacts as reasons for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire more staff. In contrast, expansion by a software developer in North Carolina will bring new jobs, and contacts in the service and manufacturing sectors reported a demand for engineers and skilled labor, although they also expressed some difficulty in finding such workers. An agent from Maryland reported increased demand for temp workers, particularly in the manufacturing sector. According to our latest survey, average retail wages rose quickly and average wages at non-retail services firms picked up moderately in recent weeks; hiring, however, was still soft. In the manufacturing sector, employment strengthened over the last month, while wage growth remained modest.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2013|3|Overall, consumer spending was weaker in late January and February, but sales were expected to improve over the next three months. Retail sales decreased since the last survey period, and retailers expected flat growth during the next three months. Store owners noted that low priced items and clothing sold well during the survey period, but sales of high end items remained slow. Auto sales were unchanged compared to the last survey period but continued to be higher than a year ago. Inventories increased, but dealers were satisfied with the overall levels. Automobile sales expectations improved for the near term. Hotel occupancy rates and tourist activity were unchanged and neither expected a change in activity in the coming months. Restaurant sales were also flat. Sales growth in the future was expected to increase moderately, but was constrained by higher food costs.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|3|District manufacturing activity weakened since the last survey period. Production activity declined at most durable goods manufacturers, but some improvements were seen in the non-durable goods sector, especially by chemical producers. Employment and new orders for exports fell compared to the previous survey period. Factory managers continued to be moderately optimistic about future activity. Production, new orders, and shipments were all expected to grow over the next few months. Manufacturers also reported that they expected employment levels to increase, but contacts continued to be concerned about tax and regulatory policies. High-tech service firms reported an increase in activity and expected strong growth during the next three months. Some contacts reported difficulty finding skilled engineers and developers. Transportation services activity was flat compared to the previous survey period and a year ago. Expectations for future transportation activity and sales were very strong, and contacts reported difficulty finding qualified workers, especially over-the-road drivers.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2013|3|Residential real estate showed brisk improvement since the last survey period, but commercial real estate activity was flat. Strong residential real estate sales continued to push prices higher and to decrease the stock of residential inventory. Real estate contacts noted that mid- to low- priced homes continued to be the strongest sellers, and that the high-end market remained slow. Expectations for future housing activity were high due to traditional increases during the spring and summer months. Contacts also cited continued low borrowing rates and improved overall confidence in the economy as reasons for optimism. Sales at construction supply firms were flat, but respondents indicated that future activity is expected to be robust. New home starts were unchanged during the survey period, but are expected to increase over the next three months. Commercial real estate sales, prices, rents and vacancy rates were all unchanged since the last survey period. However, new construction was much improved compared to a year ago and contacts expected new construction to continue to improve in the coming months.
kansas_city|Banking|2013|3|Bankers generally reported steady or modest loan demand, improving loan quality, and little change in total deposits in the recent survey period. Most bankers described their overall loan demand as the same as in the last survey, with a few bankers reporting moderately stronger demand. Respondents, on average, reported stable demand for commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, and consumer installment loans, with some strengthening in demand for commercial real estate loans. Interest rates on commercial and industrial loans continued to show moderate declines. Most bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and they also expected the outlook for loan quality to either improve or remain about the same over the next six months. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all loan categories and respondents reported total deposits as experiencing little change since last month.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2013|3|Agricultural growing conditions deteriorated further with persistent drought. Most of the winter wheat crop was in fair to poor condition with low soil moisture. While still higher than year-ago levels, crop prices edged down since the last survey period with softer export demand and slower ethanol production. Fed cattle prices held relatively steady, though feeder cattle prices rose as continued herd liquidations trimmed already low cow inventories. Robust demand from both farmers and nonfarm investors pushed farmland values to new highs, particularly for irrigated land due to water scarcity stemming from drought. District bankers reported collateral requirements held steady and ample funds were available for farm loans at historically low interest rates.
kansas_city|Energy|2013|3|In the energy sector, activity in the district improved slightly during the survey period and contacts expected further moderate improvement in the coming months. The number of active drilling rigs for both oil and natural gas were flat during the beginning of 2013, but began to edge higher in February.  contacts expected oil prices to remain at current levels during the next three months as a result of balanced supply and demand conditions. Natural gas prices were expected to decrease slightly over the next three months due to weaker demand in the spring and healthy supplies in storage. Wyoming coal output continued to fall during January, which some contacts attributed to more demand shifting to natural gas, with gas prices remaining low.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2013|3|Wage pressures continued to be weak during the survey period, but there was some upward pressure on prices. Firms continued to report changes in health care policy and fiscal uncertainty as reasons for delayed hiring. However, contacts in high-tech services, transportation services and auto dealerships noted they wished to hire, but are unable to find qualified skilled labor. Organizations that serve low- and moderate-income households also noted some improvement in job availability. Prices for raw materials at manufacturing firms continued to move higher, and more manufacturers plan to pass these costs through to finished goods prices over the next six months. Builders and construction supply firms both responded that input prices for construction have increased and that prices are expected to continue to rise over the next three months. Retail prices have also increased recently and retailers expect to raise prices further during the coming months. Increased food costs have pushed restaurant menu prices up recently and restaurant owners expect these costs to remain elevated. Transportation services contacts also reported an increase in input costs both in the current period and over the near term.
san_francisco|Prices and Wages|2013|4|Price increases for most final goods and services were limited. Reports were mixed for construction materials, with prices for some products such as cement, logs, and lumber edging up further; meanwhile, prices for some other metal and wood products were mostly flat. Contacts from retail grocery and restaurant chain establishments reported largely constant food prices as the prices of some of the underlying commodities have stabilized. Health-care price increases were limited, and fees for legal services held steady.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2013|4|Retail sales rose on balance. New and used automobile sales remained at high levels. Among computer and electronic products, sales of personal computers remained weak relative to sales of mobile computing devices, including smart phones and tablets. Demand for some gaming products and apparel picked up, with e-commerce sales growth for these items outpacing sales growth at traditional retail stores. Retail grocers reported soft sales, experiencing intensifying competition from discount and online retailers. Demand was steady for retail pet products.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2013|4|District manufacturing activity appeared to step up during the reporting period of late February through early April. Contrary to downbeat expectations from earlier in the year arising from product release challenges, production activity for commercial aircraft and parts continued to grow robustly. Manufacturers in defense-related subsectors noted furloughs, layoffs, and plant closures at some production facilities. Reports indicated that inventories of semiconductors fell at the end of last year but remain roughly in line with current demand. Pharmaceutical goods producers reported modest gains. Wood product manufacturers stated that demand grew further, fueled both by recent rebounds in domestic residential construction activity and demand from China. Demand for steel products used primarily in transportation infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects increased, although overall capacity utilization for steelmakers remained at a relatively low level.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2013|4|Agricultural producers noted increased sales and production activity. Demand for most crop and livestock products grew further. Agricultural producers faced mostly stable or somewhat lower petroleum-based fuel and natural gas costs. Supplies of most raw materials were adequate. However, some contacts communicated concerns that volatile weather conditions and limited water availability in parts of the District could pass through to lower seasonal hiring and reduced agricultural output in coming months. Reports indicated that electricity and natural gas sales remained strong for both households and businesses, and natural gas inventories declined a bit further.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2013|4|Activity in residential and commercial real estate markets continued to gain momentum, with notable gains in selected locales. Home sales climbed further in most regions, and low inventory levels coupled with healthy demand supported stable or increasing prices. Reports indicated that the pace of residential housing permit issuance increased significantly in many regions throughout the District. Rental activity for both single-family and multifamily homes was strong, based on low vacancy rates and stable rental rates. Construction of multifamily residential projects expanded further. Commercial real estate development and leasing activity increased, particularly in major metropolitan areas across the District, fueled in large part by sustained growth in the technology sector.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2013|4|Contacts from financial institutions reported that loan demand improved. Ramped-up mortgage and automobile lending continued to spur growth in overall loan demand. Banking contacts again highlighted ample liquidity and generally stiff competition among lenders for well-qualified business borrowers. Contacts also pointed to a recent buildup of privately held technology companies poised for public offerings. Despite the clear potential for action, the pace of initial public offerings and new venture capital deals in the District's Internet and digital media subsectors has been relatively slow. By contrast, private equity financing has shown steady growth in recent months. Reports indicated modest improvement in credit quality for both business and consumer loans.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2013|4|Retailers contacted for this round cite mixed results for first quarter 2013. One reports that year-over-year comp store sales were up 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent, while others report slower than expected sales. Some contacts attribute their slowdowns partly to the prolonged winter weather, noting that while this winter has been unseasonably cold in some regions, winter 2012 was unusually mild. Demand remains strong for clothing, shoes, and home furnishings. Inventories are in good shape, and any price increases are moderate. Contacts continue to expect that 2013 sales increases will be in the modest single digits.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2013|4|Conversations with a dozen manufacturing contacts paint a mixed picture. More than half report that demand for their products improved in the first quarter versus the previous quarter or a year earlier.  The two firms reporting the strongest sales growth were in the health care sector--a drug company and a medical device manufacturer--and both reported spectacular growth. At the other end of the spectrum, two firms in the semiconductor business report that sales continue to languish. One, a maker of analog devices, acknowledged that the semiconductor business is cyclical, but said that the duration of the current slowdown is unlike anything he had encountered in his years in the industry.
boston|Selected Business Services|2013|4|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report a generally strong first quarter and were positive about their firms' recent performance and near-term outlook. Marketing and advertising contacts note an uptick in growth due to clients in stronger financial positions and with more money to spend. Several contacts report robust demand for health care consulting services as the industry adapts to massive changes attributable in part to the Affordable Care Act. Economic consulting remains strong because of high levels of complex high-stakes litigation; management and strategy consulting contacts cite improved business conditions as clients have become more optimistic and seem to believe that it is time to invest for future growth. The only contact to report a bad quarter works mostly with the federal government and has been heavily affected by fiscal contraction.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2013|4|Reports from commercial real estate contacts in the First District contain much good news. Boston contacts uniformly remark that the office leasing market has firmed up in recent months and that the vacancy rate is down significantly from one year ago. Activity is particularly strong in the seaport district, but financial district towers are also seeing absorption of long-vacant space. Investment sales activity in greater Boston remains brisk, especially for multifamily structures. Planned construction projects in Boston picked up considerably, with a focus on mixed-use projects, and should lead to job gains for the sector moving forward. In Hartford, the state government purchased a large downtown office tower, absorbing a large block of Class A space, boosting business sentiment and, it is speculated, helping put upward pressure on rents. In Portland, the retail property market saw healthy leasing activity and investment sales activity picked up modestly. In Providence, progress continues on some large office leasing deals (despite not yet leading to completions), investment sales activity continues to rise, and business sentiment is seen as increasingly optimistic. On the downside, Hartford saw stagnant office leasing and virtually no construction activity, while Portland's office vacancy rate remains stubbornly high at 12 percent. Small-scale commercial real estate loan demand remains well below last year's pace, according to one regional lender. Construction materials costs are on the rise, putting pressure on profit margins at small firms in particular.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2013|4|Strong consecutive months of year-over-year growth in single-family homes sales halted in February, with some New England states experiencing marginal increases and most observing a decline. According to contacts, buyer demand remains strong, but dwindling inventory levels have hampered growth in sales. Meanwhile, median sale prices across the region rose from a year ago. Contacts attribute the price rise to the declining stock of distressed properties compared to a year ago as well as to the general decline in inventory reducing supply relative to demand. Particularly in urban areas throughout New England, decreasing inventory levels have placed upward pressure on prices. In the Greater Boston area, contacts report that multiple bids on properties have become more common as inventory continues to dwindle.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|4|Consumer spending increased moderately. March sales at a Minneapolis-St. Paul area restaurant chain were up about 6 percent from a year ago; demand for catering services was very strong. Sales activity at a Montana mall was level from a year earlier, but warmer weather was helping boost traffic over the past few weeks. Meanwhile, same-store sales at a Minneapolis area mall were down slightly, while cold, wintry weather during March reduced traffic levels. A Minnesota auto dealer noted a solid start to 2013, and is cautiously optimistic for a very good year. Truck sales were strong at dealerships in eastern North Dakota.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2013|4|Commercial construction activity continued to increase at a very fast pace since the last report. The value of March commercial permits in Billings, Mont., increased over 900 percent from last year. In Sioux Falls, S.D., March permits were $14 million, up from nearly zero a year ago. A contact at a Fargo, N.D., real estate company noted that "the medical field is building like crazy." Residential construction increased rapidly from a year ago. The value of March residential building permits in Billings nearly doubled from last year, and the value of March permits in Sioux Falls was up over 63 percent from a year ago. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, March residential permits were up 21 percent compared with March 2012.
minneapolis|Services|2013|4|Activity at professional business services firms increased at a moderate pace since the last report. A home inspector noted an increase in business due to more homeowners who were considering selling. A Minnesota travel agency noted an increase in business travel compared with a year ago. A Minnesota freight trade group expects volumes and rates to increase this year. A financial institution noted a significant increase in demand for loans.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2013|4|The District manufacturing sector continued to grow since the last report. A March survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas. A Minnesota architectural glass producer announced a $30 million expansion at a plant. A transportation vehicle maker in Minnesota was expanding its facilities. A sawmill in Montana restarted production after sitting idle for more than four years. Meanwhile, a paper mill in Minnesota cut production.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2013|4|Activity in the energy sector was steady at high levels, while mining slowed. Late-March oil and gas exploration decreased slightly in Montana and North Dakota from the last report, but production remained near record levels. A $2.2 billion modernization of Minnesota's electrical grid is under way, with an estimated $1 billion to be spent this year. A diesel refinery broke ground in North Dakota, and a separate $400 million refinery that will break ground this year was also announced. A copper-nickel mining development in the Upper Peninsula halted construction in response to "economic headwinds" and volatility in metals markets. An iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula idled at the end of March.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2013|4|The District agricultural sector remained in strong condition heading into the planting season, though persistent drought remained a threat. Early indications of planting intentions suggest District farmers plan to increase corn, soybean and hay acreage this year, with a reduction in wheat acres. An agricultural cooperative announced $50 million in investments in the District, including a grain terminal in North Dakota and a fertilizer depot in Minnesota. Prices received by farmers increased in March from a year earlier for wheat, corn, soybeans, hay, chicken, milk and eggs; prices decreased for cattle, hogs, turkeys and dry beans.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|4|Labor markets tightened somewhat. A company recently announced plans to add 300 information technology consultant jobs in South Dakota and North Dakota. A retailer recently announced plans to build a distribution center in Minnesota that would create 300 jobs. Businesses in eastern Montana noted continued challenges attracting and retaining quality workers due to competition from the nearby oil-drilling region. A record number of companies participated in a job fair in eastern South Dakota, reflecting the relatively high availability of jobs in the area. However, a Minnesota food company laid off 125 workers.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2013|4|Reports from District factories indicated that new orders and production were mostly higher during the past six weeks. Companies seeing the most activity were suppliers to the residential construction, shale gas, and transportation industries. Manufacturers serving the defense and commercial building industries experienced some weakening in new orders. Exports to Pacific Rim countries improved, while exports to Europe diminished. Compared to a year ago, manufacturing activity was mixed. Steel producers and service centers reported that the pickup in shipping volume early in the first quarter has leveled off. Excess steel produced in China and Europe is now being imported into the United States in larger quantities. Auto production at District plants rose at a moderate pace during February on a month-over-month basis. Compared to a year ago, production numbers were little changed. Many manufacturing contacts remain cautiously optimistic about near-term growth prospects.

Many manufacturing contacts remain cautiously optimistic about near-term growth prospects.
cleveland|Real Estate|2013|4|Sales of new and existing single-family homes continued on an upward trend since our last report, and sales were higher than a year ago. Contracts were found mainly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories. Demand for multi-family housing remains strong. A developer of market-rate apartments described activity as very good. Another developer said that demand for affordable rental units is surging. While builders expressed confidence that the improvement in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months, they still see the appraisal process and the availability of financing as headwinds to more robust growth. Reports indicated that list prices of new homes increased by 1 to 2 percent this year, which was attributed to shrinking inventories and rising prices for building materials, especially lumber and drywall. Builders have cut back on discounting.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2013|4|Most retailers reported that sales volume for the period from mid-February through mid-March was higher relative to the previous 30-day period. Rising volume was particularly evident in apparel and electronics. Store managers who experienced a downturn in sales cited higher gasoline prices and taxes as contributing factors. Second-quarter sales are expected to be up slightly, when compared to the same quarter last year. Vendor and shelf prices held steady. A food producer commented that agricultural commodity prices, though elevated, are fairly stable, and he anticipates little upward pressure on prices attributable to food during 2013. Capital expenditures were on plan for the fiscal year. One retail chain projected significantly higher capital investment this year, but much of it is allocated for remodeling older stores. No hiring is anticipated, except for staffing new stores.
cleveland|Banking|2013|4|Demand for business credit has picked up since our last report. Although requests originated from a broad range of sectors, commercial real estate and manufacturing stood out. Loan pricing remains under pressure. Reports on consumer credit also showed a small rise in demand, mainly for home-equity products and auto loans. Bankers noted a slight drop-off in residential mortgage activity; however, there was a definite shift in applications from refinancing to new purchase. Delinquency rates held steady or declined across consumer and commercial loan categories. No changes were made to loan-application standards. Aggregate core deposits grew; customers continue to transfer monies from non-liquid to liquid accounts. Bankers remain very concerned about shrinking net interest margins. In response, some are considering raising fees in all areas. On balance, there was little change in payrolls. Two bankers reported rising employment numbers due to acquisitions.
cleveland|Energy|2013|4|Coal production continued to trend down across the District, with lower production projected for the near term. One producer commented that demand from electric utilities has risen slightly due to an extended period of cold weather and an uptick in natural gas prices. Spot prices for metallurgical and steam-coal are up somewhat. Output from conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas wells was steady during the past couple of months. In the wet gas regions of Ohio and West Virginia, output should begin to increase later in the year as newly constructed gas processing units come on line. Well-head prices for oil and gas rose slightly. Rig count in the District was stable during the first quarter. Capital expenditures were at targeted levels, with little change expected. Production equipment and material prices were flat across most categories. Oil and gas payrolls held steady, while coal operators reported additional layoffs.
cleveland|Freight Transportation|2013|4|For the most part, our contacts reported that shipping volume was somewhat higher than expected for this time of year, although no product area stands out. Freight executives are more optimistic about growth prospects than earlier in the year, and some believe that their growth projections for 2013 may be too low. Diesel-fuel prices have started to trend down from high levels, which carriers passed through via surcharges. Costs associated with equipment and maintenance items were stable. Capital spending was generally down in the first quarter of this year relative to late last year. However, our contacts believe that spending will begin to pick up in the second quarter. One executive stated that he has an aggressive spending plan in place, which includes capacity and footprint expansion. Hiring is for replacement and capacity expansion. New hours-of-service regulations (federal) may prompt additional hiring, but it will put upward pressure on shipping prices. Wage pressures are contained.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|4|District merchants reported mixed results from mid-February through March. Several contacts indicated improvements in profit margins and sales over the last three months, while others noted that they experienced the result of consumers taking a hit with the expiration of the payroll tax cut, increased fuel prices, a delay in income tax refunds, and increased health insurance premiums. Yet, even with these challenges, most retailers remained reasonably upbeat. District automotive contacts cited favorable sales for the same time period.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2013|4|According to District brokers, housing markets across the region continued to improve. Recent sales growth was described as strong on a year-over-year basis. Existing home inventories continued to contract and brokers noted that this was restraining sales. Furthermore, many reported receiving multiple offers on properties, particularly at the low-end of the market. Most indicated that home prices rose modestly compared with a year earlier. Appreciation was strongest among Florida contacts. Overall, the outlook for existing home sales growth over the next several months remained positive.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2013|4|Regional manufacturers reported that activity expanded for the third consecutive month in March. Increases in new orders, production, employment, and finished inventory contributed to the highest level of manufacturing activity since May 2012. Contacts noted profit margins slightly improved from mid-February through March. However, they do not expect production to be as high in the coming months as they had in our previous report.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2013|4|Driven by historically low rates, consumers continued refinancing mortgage loans and businesses continued restructuring debt. Competition remained intense for high quality loan applicants and community bankers noted that large regional and national banking organizations were more willing to offer lower fixed-rate, longer-termed loans to attract these customers. Many community banking contacts indicated that their institution had exited the mortgage lending business altogether because of increased regulations. Some stated that commercial real estate loan demand had increased, particularly for branded hotel construction, healthcare, and multi-family projects. Banks also cited more willingness to lend to small businesses; however, the overall demand for loans and credit line usage continued to remain low. Credit spreads remained tight and some bankers reported downward pressure on loan pricing.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2013|4|Since our last report, payroll growth continued to increase at a lackluster pace across the District, though contacts continued to report that uncertainty over fiscal policy and healthcare reform were contributing to reluctance in hiring. In Florida and Georgia, the two states in the District with the largest concentrations of employment, unemployment rates declined slightly since the previous report, while unemployment rates have fluctuated in the four other states due to changes in the size of those states' labor force.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2013|4|The energy industry remained an especially bright spot in the region. In particular, projects to increase the Gulf Coast's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity--through investment in new LNG export facilities at ports and new transportation infrastructure, like pipeline and LNG tanks--were strong drivers of capital and labor demand.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2013|4|Retailers report that sales were generally brisk in March. One major chain reports that same-store sales were ahead of plan--especially in and around New York City--and up modestly from March 2012 levels. A contact in upstate New York also reports that mall sales were brisk in March and up from a year ago, following a tepid performance in February; some of the recent strength is attributed to Canadian shoppers. Inventories are reported to be in good shape, prices are characterized as steady, and no unusual discounting is reported.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2013|4|Residential real estate markets in the District have shown increasingly widespread signs of improvement in recent weeks. New York City apartment rents, which had flattened out in the final months of 2012, have accelerated in early 2013 and are reported to be up 6-7 percent from a year ago in Manhattan and by somewhat more in Brooklyn. With respect to the city's co-op and condo market, a major appraisal firm reports that sales volume has strengthened, while the inventory of apartments for sale is down sharply to one of the lowest levels on record. Most of the new development is at the upper end of the market, while low inventories across the rest of the spectrum have begun to drive up selling prices across New York City, as well as in Westchester County and Long Island. Multiple offers (bidding wars), though hardly the norm, are becoming more frequent across the region. Prime areas of Brooklyn, where market conditions are particularly strong, are reported to be seeing a good deal of commercial-to-residential conversion. Similarly, an expert on northern New Jersey's housing market reports continued improvement in market conditions: the volume of distressed properties there has been shrinking, with noticeably fewer homes moving into delinquency or foreclosure recently. Still, prices have moved up only modestly, held back by a slow foreclosure process. Buffalo-area Realtors also report strong market fundamentals--declining inventories and fairly rapid price appreciation.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2013|4|Contacts in both manufacturing and other sectors report steady business activity in recent weeks, while they remain broadly optimistic about prospects for 2013. In general, price pressures are reported to be steady and moderate in the manufacturing sector but more widespread among service-sector businesses; a small but growing number of service-sector contacts say they are increasing their selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2013|4|Small- to medium-sized banks report an increase in demand for commercial loans and mortgages but little change in demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Bankers report an uptick in demand for refinancing. Credit standards are reported to be unchanged across all loan categories. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly for consumer loans, where roughly one in four bankers reports lower spreads and no respondent reports higher spreads. Respondents also indicate continued decreases in average deposit rates. Finally, bankers report continued modest declines in delinquency rates on all categories of loans.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2013|4|Growth in consumer spending edged lower in March. Retailers reported higher inventory levels in part because lingering winter weather delayed the introduction of spring-related merchandise sitting in their warehouses. Some contacts indicated that the end of the payroll tax credit was having an increasingly negative effect on retail sales. Nonetheless, sales during the Easter holiday were largely in-line with expectations. Home improvement and clothing stores reported lower sales than during the previous reporting period, but discount stores noted an increase in sales of apparel. Sales of furniture and appliances also rose, buoyed by the recent upswing in the housing market. In contrast, auto sales leveled off. Dealers are still optimistic that sales will rise further year than last year, and are building inventory for the spring selling season. Used vehicle prices remained elevated, boosting trade-in values. In addition, dealers noted that customers' credit profiles continue to improve, allowing more of them to qualify for auto loans.
chicago|Business Spending|2013|4|Growth in business spending picked up in March. Inventory levels increased slightly, and spending on equipment and software and on structures picked up. However, a number of manufacturing contacts reiterated that they plan to make capital expenditures this year only as necessary, delaying investments because of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. Labor market conditions improved slightly. Hiring continued to increase. Contacts indicated that there is still strong demand for talent in skilled professional and manufacturing jobs, and that shortages of qualified candidates remain in many of these occupations. In addition, a staffing firm reported an increase in demand for its services from the manufacturing sector. Other signs of improving labor demand also were reported, such as greater competition among employers to fill internships this year and a stronger job market for new college graduates.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2013|4|Construction and real estate activity increased in March. Demand for residential construction rose, reflecting both continued strength in multifamily construction and an improving single-family housing market. The gains have helped buoy confidence among homebuilders. Development of single-family homes in urban areas picked up some after years of limited activity. More generally, home prices have increased for both new and existing homes, with inventories of homes for sale shrinking. Growth in nonresidential construction, particularly for smaller retail stores and in the industrial sector, continued to be moderate. Commercial real estate conditions also continued to improve, with rents increasing and vacancy rates decreasing.
chicago|Manufacturing|2013|4|Growth in manufacturing production slowed in March. Several contacts speculated that the uncertainty surrounding sequestration had affected their customer's orders. However, they had yet to see much evidence of this in their shipments. That said, a contact did note that his military customers were actively seeking to squeeze out any potential inefficiencies in their supply chain in an effort to lower their costs in anticipation of tighter future defense budgets. Demand for steel was flat, and steel service center inventories were slightly above desirable levels. Specialty metal manufacturers reported declines in new orders, although backlogs remained elevated. Activity in the energy sector was mixed, with natural gas-related industries reporting stronger activity but the coal industry remaining weaker. Demand for heavy equipment was also mixed. Mining activity, particularly for coal, continued to decline. However, contacts indicated that construction equipment distributors and rental companies remain optimistic, pointing to the ongoing recovery in the housing market as a potential source of strength in the second half of the year. Demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks remained firm; and the auto industry continued to be a source of strength. Manufacturers of building materials and consumer products also noted an increase in demand with the exception of lawn and garden equipment.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2013|4|Credit conditions remained favorable over the reporting period. Credit spreads and financial market volatility continued to be low. Banking contacts reported moderate growth in business lending, especially to small businesses and for the purposes of expanding and upgrading of facilities. Real estate lending also reportedly picked up. Increased competition for borrowers was noted to be putting downward pressure on pricing and loosening commercial and industrial loan standards. Consumer borrowing also rose modestly, with a further increase in auto lending reported over the reporting period. Several financial contacts noted that the recent rise in equity and home prices appear to be boosting consumer confidence and spending. That said, a financial services industry contact indicated that consumer borrowing had been lower than anticipated given recent increases in consumer spending.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2013|4|Cost pressures were roughly unchanged, on balance, in March. Commodity prices were down slightly, and energy prices remained elevated. Scrap metal prices continued to decline, and a contact in the industry speculated that weaker demand from China was largely to blame. Contacts did note some upward price pressure on raw materials such as chemicals, lumber, and concrete as well as on transportation costs, but said that pass-through to downstream prices was limited. Retailers reported mostly modest wholesale price increases. Wage pressures remained moderate, although several contacts indicated increasing concern over the rising cost of healthcare. Other cost pressures that were mentioned included higher property taxes and regulatory costs.
chicago|Agriculture|2013|4|Cold weather delayed field work during the reporting period, but there was little concern expressed by contacts that planting would be seriously delayed. Corn and soybean prices dropped based on expectations of a larger crop this year and current stocks that are not as tight as anticipated. Contacts indicated that the number of soybean acres should be higher than the prior year in the District, while corn acres should be lower. Farmers seemed to increase their levels of crop insurance relative to last year. Milk prices moved lower during the reporting period, but remained above the levels of a year ago. Hog prices fell and were under year-ago levels. Cattle prices moved sideways during the reporting period, but were below the levels of a year ago. Some livestock producers were reportedly taking advantage of low long-term interest rates by refinancing and lengthening the maturity of their debt.
dallas|Prices|2013|4|Most responding firms said prices were stable, although housing contacts said home prices increased at a fast pace, and cotton prices increased according to agriculture contacts. Staffing firms noted no change in rates, and accounting firms said rates were flat to slightly up. Food producers said selling prices were up since January but do not expect more increases going forward. One airline said ticket prices were up slightly. Retail prices and auto prices were steady. Financial services contacts said loan pricing was flat to down. Oil prices fell slightly, as the price of WTI averaged under $94 per barrel over the past six weeks. A late winter reduced natural gas inventories and pushed prices above $3.65. Gasoline and diesel prices increased since the last report.
dallas|Labor Market|2013|4|Employment held steady or increased at most responding firms. Food manufacturers and airlines said employment had increased, and reports of scattered hiring came from some accounting and finance firms, retailers, auto dealers and transportation manufacturers. Several contacts noted difficulty finding qualified people to fill open positions, particularly in banking, auto sales and manufacturing. Staffing firms said the supply of labor was tight in the Houston energy sector.
dallas|Manufacturing|2013|4|Construction-related manufacturers said demand was flat to up slightly. A lumber contact noted a seasonal increase in demand for the first time in several years. A cement producer said demand remained strong, particularly for residential construction projects. Expectations among construction-related producers are for increases in demand, and contacts believe 2013 will be stronger than 2012. Fabricated metals producers reported a broad-based increase in demand over the reporting period. Demand reports from primary metals manufacturers were mixed and below year-ago levels.
dallas|Retail Sales|2013|4|Retail sales were up since the previous report and from a year ago, according to contacts. Texas continued to perform well, and according to one national retailer the rate of sales growth in Texas outperformed the nation during the reporting period. Prices remained stable since the last report. Some contacts added employees in line with expanding operations. Outlooks for the quarter ranged from cautiously positive to good, and contacts expect steady growth for the remainder of the year.
dallas|Nonfinancial Services|2013|4|Staffing firms said demand was flat or down since the last report. Responding placement firms noted activity in most sectors was sluggish, with the exception of energy-related activity in Houston and overall demand for residential construction workers. Outlooks were mixed, but better than earlier in the year. Accounting firms noted continued strong demand for their services. Demand for energy, audit, insurance, consulting work and transactions was robust, while demand for tax services remained flat. Outlooks were optimistic. Legal firms said growth in demand for their services was weaker than expected, with the exception of strong real-estate related activity. Outlooks were optimistic, with contacts expecting a pickup in activity over the next three months.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2013|4|Texas home prices rose rapidly due to strong demand and very low inventories. Some builders were still finding financing difficult. Outlooks for the single-family housing sector were positive, but price gains are expected to slow later in the year as building activity picks up. Contacts said apartment demand remains strong, in part, thanks to strong job growth and migration. Commercial real estate contacts reported that gains in occupancy and rents may be slowing property sales as owning has become more profitable. Most contacts noted banks were more aggressive with lending, and Texas office and warehouse markets were improving.
dallas|Financial Services|2013|4|Financial institutions reported broad-based growth in loan demand. Consumer lending improved, with solid growth in mortgage and automobile lending activity. Commercial lending grew at a moderate pace, and energy-related activity remained strong in Houston, Austin, San Antonio and the Eagle Ford area. Commercial real estate and home equity lending activity has started to bounce back from low levels, noted contacts. Non-performing loans continued to decline. Loan pricing remained very competitive. Deposits and deposit rates remained mostly unchanged. Outlooks were optimistic, and contacts expect growth in loan demand and deposits to continue in the near term.
dallas|Energy|2013|4|activity was slightly improved, and respondents at energy-related service firms seemed more confident that the number of active drilling rigs may have bottomed out. Margins for services, particularly pressure pumping, remained tight, and contacts reported little change in pricing pressures otherwise. Contacts said drilling activity was flat over the reporting period and continue to expect improvement in the second half of the year, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico.
dallas|Agriculture|2013|4|Drought conditions worsened slightly across the District over the reporting period. Nearly half of the Texas wheat crop was in poor or very poor condition, and spring crops were largely being planted into very dry soil. Texas feedlots continued to run negative margins, due in part to feed costs remaining elevated. Cotton was a bright spot, with continued strong demand and rising prices.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|4|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our previous report. Several manufacturing firms reported significant plans to add workers, expand operations, or open new facilities in the Eighth District, while a smaller number of manufacturers reported plans to lay off workers. Firms in printing, food, housewares, automobile parts, jewelry, metal, lumber products, and beverage manufacturing plan to hire new employees and expand operations in the near future. In contrast, a firm that manufactures aircraft parts announced plans to lay off workers in the District.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2013|4|Home sales have continued to increase throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2012, February 2013 year-to-date home sales were up 12 percent in Louisville, 14 percent in Little Rock, 4 percent in Memphis, and 11 percent in St. Louis. February 2013 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2012. Permits increased 16 percent in Memphis and 36 percent in St. Louis. In contrast, permits decreased 8 percent in Little Rock and remained unchanged in Louisville over the same period.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2013|4|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and midsized District banks were virtually unchanged from mid-December 2012 to mid-March 2013. Real estate lending, which accounts for 72.8 percent of total loans, increased 1.9 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.1 percent of total loans, increased 3.9 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of total loans were largely unchanged. All other loans, accounting for 7.3 percent of total loans, decreased 14.1 percent. During the same period, total deposits at these banks increased 4.3 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|4|Farmers in the District's states expect to plant more sorghum and soybeans in 2013 than was planted in 2012; they also anticipate planting less corn, cotton, and rice. Additionally, Arkansas and Mississippi farmers expect to significantly increase corn acreage while reducing cotton and rice acreage. As of early April, over 90 percent of the District's winter wheat crop was rated in fair or better condition, and over 60 percent was rated as good to excellent. Year-to-date coal production in the District's states (excluding eastern Kentucky) at the end of February was 4.7 percent lower than the same period last year. Similarly, coal production for February was 5.7 percent lower than February 2012.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2013|4|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported that orders and shipments have risen slightly. The makers of food products, lumber and wood products, fabricated metals, industrial machinery, electronic equipment, and instruments have reported gains since the last Beige Book. The makers of primary metals reported lower activity. Contacts have attributed the greatest gains to ongoing auto-related demand and growing demand from housing-related sectors; the greatest uncertainty was attached to military-related sectors.
philadelphia|Retail|2013|4|Third District retailers reported modest growth overall in February and March. After a falloff in sales (year over year) at many malls in February, contacts report that March sales were stronger and that an early Easter should boost the month's final results. During March, stores had increased their promotions to move spring apparel to make way for the arrival of the summer lineup; meanwhile, lingering cold weather had shoppers still searching for appropriate winter wear. In contrast, shoppers enjoyed warmer overall temperatures last year, including one 80-degree day during March to splurge on spring clothes.
philadelphia|Finance|2013|4|Overall, loan growth among Third District financial firms has softened somewhat since the previous Beige Book  growing little if at all. Contacts suggested the lull might be partially explained by the relative dearth of big deals in the wake of the fourth quarter frenzy, plus more immediate concerns for the pending sequestration impacts. Mortgage refinancings as a percent of total mortgages fell at many firms (often from as much as 90 percent to 75 percent). Total loans secured by any real estate fell slightly during the period. Most bank contacts report little change in credit standards and slow, steady gains in quality; many continue to report aggressive behavior from some of their bank and nonbank competitors. Financial institutions remain optimistic about future growth; however, the horizon for this growth appears farther away.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2013|4|Homebuilders reported that contract activity was near plan for February and March. Modest year-over-year growth rates were slower than last period; however, more new homes were rising from the ground in the first quarter of 2013 than in any year since 2008. Compared with historical patterns, current new construction tends to be smaller, more affordable, more rental, and more urban. Builders are prepared to hire if current trends continue but are reporting that good labor is increasingly scarce. Residential brokers reported little change in the moderate pace of sales; however, year-over-year growth in February was modest compared with last year when weather was unseasonably warm. The existing inventory of homes continues to fall, and bank contacts reported that investor loans used to convert residential properties to rentals are increasing.
philadelphia|Services|2013|4|Third District service-sector firms have maintained a modest pace of growth overall since the last Beige Book. Resorts in the Poconos were still enjoying an extended ski season, as their golf season was getting underway. Moderate growth through their winter season was boosted by early spring holiday weekends. Expectations that the positive trend will continue were buoyed by strong bookings for Memorial Day. Strong, early bookings for summer were also reported by the operators of Delaware shore hotels, who report getting more inquiries from New Jersey and New York residents this year. However, casino revenues for February fell by double digits in Atlantic City and by nearly eight percent throughout Pennsylvania from the prior-year levels.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2013|4|Overall, price levels continued to increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Manufacturing firms reported only modest cost pressures and a slight decline in prices received--essentially unchanged from last period. Auto dealers reported no changes in pricing. Homebuilders continued to note higher prices, especially for lumber and labor costs. Higher-end homebuilders reported some ability to make price increases stick. Real estate contacts continued to report that low-end house prices are firm or rising slightly, while high-end home prices are still falling in most markets. Outside of homebuilders, contacts continued to report that wages rose only slightly, if at all. Contacts continued to relay a wide range of costs and strategies to provide medical insurance benefits for their employees; their decision processes remain fraught with confusion and uncertainty.
summary|Manufacturing|2013|4|activity held steady or increased in most Districts since the previous Beige Book. The pace of growth picked up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while the Richmond and Chicago Districts noted that the pace of growth in production was slower than earlier this year. Contacts in the Boston District reported mixed conditions, and manufacturing activity held steady in the New York District.  conditions in the Kansas City District continued to soften, driven by weaker durable goods production, although factory managers project a rebound in coming months. Firms in the New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts were broadly optimistic about prospects for 2013, while cautious optimism was expressed by manufacturers in the Cleveland District, and mixed outlooks were expressed in the Boston District. Contacts in the Atlanta District do not expect future production to be as high as previously projected.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|4|Most Districts reported increases in retail spending. Firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted sales increased at a modest to moderate pace. Most retailers in the Boston District said demand was slower than expected. Sales activity was mixed according to the Atlanta District's report, and retail spending declined in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Demand for apparel rose in the Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, and sales of furniture and appliances in the Chicago District were buoyed by improvements in the housing market. Sales of electronics rose in the Cleveland District, and the San Francisco District report indicated strong demand for mobile computing devices. Contacts in some Districts cited higher gasoline prices, expiration of the payroll tax cut, and winter weather as factors restraining sales growth. Looking ahead, retailers in several Districts expect modest sales growth in the near term. In particular, the St. Louis District reported new store openings, and some retailers in the Dallas District said they have added employees in line with expanding operations.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2013|4|Demand for nonfinancial services expanded at a modest pace since the previous report. The Kansas City and San Francisco Districts noted solid growth in information technology services, and contacts expect demand to remain robust through year-end. The Boston District reported strong demand for healthcare consulting services partly due to changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act, while healthcare firms in the San Francisco District indicated plans to freeze hiring and scale back capital expenditures in response to federal spending cuts. Defense-related and other firms dependent on the federal government in the Philadelphia District said they expect a decline in activity for the remainder of the year.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2013|4|Residential real estate activity continued to improve in most Districts, and some Districts, including Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, noted increased momentum since the last report. The New York District, in particular, noted especially strong improvement in residential real estateboth in for-sale housing and apartment markets.
summary|Banking and Finance|2013|4|Loan demand was steady to slightly up at most District Banks that commented on lending. The Philadelphia District, however, said loan volumes softened somewhat since the previous report. The New York District noted widespread increases in loan demand, particularly for commercial loans and residential mortgages, and the Cleveland District said business and consumer loan demand picked up since the last report. The Dallas District saw broad-based improvement in loan demand as energy-related lending remained strong and commercial real estate and home equity lending bounced up from low levels. The San Francisco District said increased growth in automobile and mortgage loans spurred overall improvements in loan demand. Several Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, said loan pricing was very competitive.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|4|Agricultural conditions were mixed across Districts, largely due to varying weather patterns. Drought persisted in the Kansas City District and worsened slightly in the Dallas District, straining the respective winter wheat crops and causing continued losses in the livestock sector. However, drought conditions improved significantly in much of the Atlanta District, and the winter wheat crop in the St. Louis District was largely in good condition. Cold weather delayed field preparation for spring planting in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. The Minneapolis District's agricultural sector remained strong, and producers in the San Francisco District noted increased production as well as higher demand. Farmers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts plan to increase soybean acreage this year but were mixed in their plans for corn and other grain acreage. Contacts in the Chicago District noted that corn and soybean prices dropped over the reporting period based on expectations of a larger crop this year and current stocks not being as tight as anticipated.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|4|Labor market conditions remained unchanged or improved slightly, and reports of hiring were more widespread in the manufacturing, residential construction, information technology, and professional services sectors. Several Districts noted robust demand for workers tied to the residential construction sector, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco. In particular, a lumber and wood products firm in the Philadelphia District said the firming housing market had resulted in the best growth prospects in five years. Demand for information technology professionals and engineers was strong in the New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Staffing firms in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted an increase in orders from the manufacturing sector, and several manufacturers in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts said they planned on expanding their payrolls. Reports from the New York and Richmond Districts indicated strong demand for temporary workers. The Minneapolis District noted a tightening labor market, and along with the Dallas District cited continued challenges in attracting and retaining workers in areas close to oil-drilling regions. The Chicago District cited a stronger job market for new college graduates and more competition among employers to fill intern positions. Contacts in several Districts faced difficulties finding highly trained or skilled workers, especially in the information technology and engineering fields. In contrast, hiring activity was limited in the Boston and Cleveland Districts, demand for staffing services softened in the Dallas District, and some Districts, including Richmond and Atlanta, reported restrained hiring due to uncertainty over fiscal policy or healthcare reform.
richmond|Manufacturing|2013|4|Fifth District manufacturing production expanded at a somewhat slower pace since our last report. A textile maker reported that his business was slow with the exception of automotive products. He expected a pickup in non-automotive business during the next few months, however. A producer of electrical components told us that business was poor in the U.S. but good in Europe and Latin America. Additionally, a textile manufacturer indicated that while sales levels had improved, his outlook remained cautious. Moreover, a dental equipment producer noted that work volumes had increased earlier this year, but that the market recently softened. On the other hand, a manufacturer of technical foam products commented that sales through the first quarter of 2013 had been solid and he expected a strong year. According to our latest survey, prices grew at a slightly slower rate for both raw materials and finished goods.
richmond|Ports|2013|4|We received a variety of reports on District port activity. A port executive commented that European-bound vessels were leaving the port lighter than in the past, which he attributed to weaker economies there. In particular, exports of construction and agricultural equipment were down since the start of 2013. In a smaller District port, container shipments matched year-ago levels, while exports of lumber and plywood recently picked up, and corn and grain exports from the Midwest were up over last year's low, drought-related levels. A contact in West Virginia remarked on port bottlenecks of coal exports. Container traffic increased at larger District ports, with continued strength in trade of auto parts. Drivers of import growth in recent weeks were consumer housing goods such as furniture and flooring. The inland port in Greer, South Carolina remained on target to officially open in the third quarter of 2013; that port is expected to shift cargo from trucks to railroads.
richmond|Retail|2013|4|sales fell in recent weeks in most categories, and shopper traffic was down. In Virginia Beach, a store manager at a chain discount store commented that persistent cold weather softened overall sales, particularly sales of seasonal items. In contrast, a few surveyed retailers and wholesalers in construction-related lines indicated that revenues rose over the reporting period. Also, auto sales remained constant at high levels. Consumer confidence, improved stability in middle-class home values, and low interest rates underpinned strong sales and good performance on auto financing. Contacts in the industry noted that used car prices remained relatively high, narrowing the spread relative to new car prices. Survey respondents indicated that overall, retail price increases were less prevalent since our last report.
richmond|Services|2013|4|Activity at services firms remained steady at a moderate pace. Seasonal businesses such as tax services and landscaping reported higher revenues, while most other services providers noted little change. Prices at services firms rose at a slower pace, according to our latest survey.
richmond|Finance|2013|4|Loan demand remained relatively stable since our last assessment. Although most bankers reported a slight uptick in demand for residential mortgages, they noted that demand for both commercial mortgages and other business loans flattened. An exception was a banker in North Carolina who cited a modest increase in business loan demand driven by the need to replace assets. In addition, no significant changes in delinquencies or credit quality were reported, apart from improvement reported by an Eastern Shore banker and a West Virginia contact. Bankers indicated that competition continued to intensify, compressing already-tight margins. A few lenders said that their competitors were lowering collateral requirements and fixing interest rates for a longer period, just to close deals. Contacts also reported a decrease in customers' willingness to take on debt. For example, a Virginia banker observed that prospective homebuyers now request a specific monthly payment and no longer inquire about the maximum amount for which they could qualify.
richmond|Real Estate|2013|4|Residential real estate activity generally strengthened in this reporting period. A contact in North Carolina stated that residential real estate was booming and inventories were low. A Realtor in the Washington, D.C. area reported an increase in purchases for renovation and resale. He stated that inventory was down thirty-five percent from last year, and some developers were offering all cash, non-contingent contracts for well above list price. Similarly, a Realtor in the metro-Richmond area said foot traffic rose, which he attributed to the limited supply of homes, pent up demand, and low interest rates. A contact in Charlotte reported that low inventories of residential building materials had put building permits on hold. Similarly, a source in Hampton Roads, Virginia reported that sequestration had put potential buyers on the sidelines.
richmond|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|4|Cold temperatures and wet weather delayed land preparation and hindered spring plantings in the agricultural sector. Hay supplies were running low in some regions, resulting in higher demand for supplemental feeding. However, a contact on the Eastern Shore of Maryland stated that poultry production and agriculture were doing well, grain and land prices were good, and the overall outlook was positive.
richmond|Labor Markets|2013|4|Assessments of labor market activity were mixed since our last report. On the one hand, manufacturing firms in the Carolinas reported temporary layoffs due to softness in orders, and contacts in sectors from real estate to wholesale trade to manufacturing said that they were reducing staff or not expanding due to the Affordable Care Act. On the other hand, a Maryland firm planned to add 200 to 250 engineers as a result of the recent pick-up in construction, and a lumber firm increased its average employee work week. Moreover, contacts from a number of temp agencies cited stronger demand for workers, resulting in part from uncertainty about federal fiscal policies. The highest demand was for information technology workers; short supply pushed up their wages. Demand for telecommunication workers picked up, as carriers upgraded systems. Additionally, demand for automobile industry workers strengthened. According to our latest surveys, average wages at non-retail services firms rose more quickly, while manufacturing wages rose at a slower pace in recent weeks and retail wages declined.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2013|4|Consumer spending was stronger than expected in March and was expected to strengthen further in the coming months. After falling during the last survey period, District retailers reported modest, but stronger-than-expected sales in March and positive expectations for future sales growth. Lower-priced items such as apparel and hardware sold well, while demand for higher-priced premium and custom goods remained weak. Some store owners noted that the payroll tax increase and cold weather during March limited sales growth. Auto sales bounced back in March, and most dealers were optimistic that sales would rise further during the next few months. Smaller cars and used vehicles continued to sell well, while dealers reported slower demand for larger cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Tourism contacts reported a rise in visitor counts compared to the last survey and expected a seasonal increase in tourism spending with warmer weather. District hoteliers indicated that occupancy rates rose with a slight drop in average room rental rates. Restaurant owners reported solid sales and slightly higher average check amounts.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2013|4|Residential real estate activity rose sharply in March, and commercial real estate activity strengthened. In addition to a seasonal rise in home sales during the spring, real estate agents commented that pent-up buyer demand, an improving economy and low interest rates were driving stronger sales. Low- and mid-priced homes in good condition continued to sell quickly, and some real estate contacts noted increased demand for investment properties. Brisk sales and lower home inventories spurred further home price increases. Residential mortgage lenders reported a jump in loan applications for home purchases, and some real estate contacts were concerned that appraisals were not reflecting current market conditions amid rapid price increases. Housing starts were up sharply from the previous survey, but some builders noted that a lack of available sub-contractors could constrain construction in the coming months. Sales at construction supply firms rose with increased building activity. Commercial real estate markets improved, and District contacts expected additional strength in coming months. New commercial construction edged up and was expected to gain momentum as vacancy rates trended down and rents moved higher. Commercial sales activity and real estate prices rose well above year-ago levels. Developers reported no change in access to credit.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|4|After softening in March, District manufacturing activity was expected to rebound in the coming months, and sales at transportation and high-tech service firms improved during the survey period. District manufacturing activity remained slightly below year-ago levels driven by weaker durable goods production, particularly for machinery and fabricated metal products. In contrast, non-durable goods production rose modestly with an uptick in food and chemical processing. After falling during the last survey period, the volume of new orders and shipments stabilized in March and was expected to strengthen during the next six months. Export orders, however, remained weak. Looking ahead, more plant managers planned to add workers and increase work hours to handle an expected rise in production. Some District factories and transportation firms were also making capital investments. Trucking traffic picked up, but qualified drivers were still in short supply. Business activity at high-tech firms expanded further, and sales were expected to remain strong. Some high-tech companies reported difficulty finding software developers and experienced IT technicians.
kansas_city|Banking|2013|4|In the recent survey period, bankers generally reported stable loan demand, improving loan quality, and stronger deposits. Bankers reported steady demand for commercial and industrial loans, residential and commercial real estate loans, and consumer installment loans. Although residential real estate loan demand increased for purchases, bankers noted fewer loans for home refinancing. Bankers reported that interest rates trended lower on commercial and industrial loans. A majority of bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and they expected further improvements during the next six months. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and respondents reported stronger deposit growth.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2013|4|Agricultural growing conditions remained poor in most of the District. March precipitation provided little relief to persistent drought, and the winter wheat crop was still in fair to poor condition. Despite recent declines, crop prices remained elevated due to short crop supplies, and District farmers did not plan to significantly alter their current crop mix. Livestock operators continued to post losses with falling cattle and hog prices and high feed costs. Pork exports remained weak, but beef exports edged up, partly due to less restricted trade with Japan. Operating loan demand remained soft as crop insurance payments bolstered farm income. Farmland values rose further and were expected to stay elevated.
kansas_city|Energy|2013|4|In the energy sector, District activity remained solid and was expected to strengthen slightly heading into summer. An upswing in oil prices and an anticipated seasonal rise in demand kept the number of active oil rigs in the District above year-ago levels. Even though colder than usual temperatures reduced natural gas inventories and boosted prices, the effect was expected to be temporary and the number of active natural gas rigs in the District dipped during March. Looking ahead, some District contacts were concerned that permitting delays could constrain oil and gas exploration. Wyoming's coal production remained well below year-ago levels as more electricity was being generated from natural gas. District ethanol production held steady, but profit margins improved recently due to lower corn prices.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2013|4|Wage pressures remained relatively subdued during the survey period, raw materials prices climbed, and some finished goods prices rose. More firms indicated they would be adding staff in the coming months to handle an anticipated increase in business activity, but most were not planning to raise wages. However, some companies, particularly those recruiting workers with specialized skills such as engineers, software developers, and commercial truck drivers, were increasing salaries. The cost of raw materials for manufacturing remained elevated, and some firms were raising finished goods prices. Some construction supply companies reported passing along higher prices for building materials, particularly lumber, to customers. Retail prices edged up, and retailers expected prices to trend higher during the next few months. Restaurant owners planned further menu price increases due to rising food costs.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|6|Price inflation was limited for most final goods and services during the reporting period, with the notable exceptions of food and gasoline. Although the prices of a wide range of commodities and raw materials remained elevated, the pass-through to final prices has been limited. For most retail goods and services, tepid demand and robust competition continued to hold down final prices.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|6|Retail sales rose further on balance. Although consumers' focus on necessities continued, the reports noted a slight shift back toward discretionary spending. Modest improvements in sales were reported for discount chains as well as for traditional department stores, and inventories generally were at or near desired levels given the pace of sales, enabling many retailers to reduce their reliance on promotional activities. For retailers of big-ticket items such as major appliances and furniture, however, sales remained somewhat weak. Similarly, sales were largely flat for grocers. Demand for new automobiles continued to strengthen, although sales growth was restrained somewhat by high fuel prices and shortages of new Japanese-made vehicles associated with the recent natural disaster in that country. The availability of used vehicles tightened further, primarily for imported models, which has propped up their sale prices and trade-in values.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|6|District manufacturing activity posted further net gains during the reporting period of late April through the end of May. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products reported continued growth in new orders and sales as well as high levels of capacity utilization, with few supply constraints arising from the crisis in Japan. Activity fell slightly for metal fabricators, as demand growth eased in the wake of strong gains in preceding months. Production rates remained solid for makers of commercial aircraft and parts, with modest growth in new orders adding to an existing order backlog. Capacity utilization rates dropped a bit for petroleum refiners, as domestic demand for gasoline stalled in response to elevated prices. Reports from food and beverage manufacturers indicated that demand for their products was largely stable or up somewhat.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|6|Sales of agricultural products were robust, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production expanded further. Orders and sales continued to grow for a wide variety of crop and livestock products. However, contacts noted some supply constraints: input costs have risen overall, and unseasonably cold weather delayed the development of some crops in California and the Pacific Northwest. Demand for natural gas continued to expand, propelled in part by cold spring weather, and oil extraction activity grew further in response to rising overseas demand.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|6|Demand in District residential real estate markets was largely unchanged at very low levels, while conditions improved slightly in commercial real estate markets. The pace of sales for new and existing homes in the District continued to be very weak on net, with distressed properties and entry-level homes reportedly dominating the sales mix in some areas. As a result, new home construction remained moribund and home prices were stable to down. By contrast, conditions continued to be stronger in apartment markets, particularly in the Seattle area: rental rates there reportedly are growing at an annual rate of 10 to 15 percent, spurring significant increases in construction activity. Vacancy rates for office and industrial space stayed elevated throughout the District, but further improvements in demand were noted for several major markets. This was particularly the case in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, with revived developer interest in new construction reported for the latter area.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|6|Reports from District banking contacts indicated that loan demand and overall credit quality rose modestly since the last reporting period. Businesses in some areas have exhibited a slight increase in their willingness to engage in expansionary capital spending, which caused demand for commercial and industrial loans to rise. Demand for consumer credit remained largely stable. Despite improvements in overall credit quality, lending standards remained relatively restrictive for many types of consumer and business loans. However, contacts reported that competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses has continued to intensify, placing downward pressure on rates and fees. Contacts also pointed to continued growth in venture capital financing activity, driven primarily by investments in the Internet and digital media sectors.
boston|Retail|2011|6|First District retailers report mixed sales results for the period from late March through mid May, with comparable same-store sales ranging from low double-digit decreases to low single-digit increases. A few contacted retailers mention decreases in demand, and all express concern about the negative impact of rising fuel prices on their own costs, especially shipping, and on consumers' shopping habits.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|6|Business conditions continue to be good at surveyed manufacturers. A parts manufacturer for autos and other vehicles reports that it is struggling to keep up with increased demand. A firm in the semiconductor industry also cites very strong sales growth in the first quarter of this year continuing into the second quarter. Reports from local pharmaceutical manufacturers are also favorable, especially compared with the end of last year, and a company in the medical devices business notes improving sales of its traditional product line after a lengthy period of very sluggish growth. Overall, contacted manufacturers are cautiously optimistic that growth will continue at a reasonable pace for the rest of the second quarter and into the second half of the year. Some firms, however, expect sales growth to moderate somewhat, in part because the second half of 2010 was strong for many respondents.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2011|6|New England software and information technology firms report modest increases in activity through May. Year-over-year revenue increases, ranging from 4 percent to 20 percent, were generally driven by increases in software license revenues, while maintenance contracts grew at a slower rate. Contacts report pick-ups in demand across sectors, including manufacturing, financial, and medical. Increased activity has led to increasing headcounts, many by more than 5 percent from a year ago. Contacts generally cite a tightening labor market, especially for specialized technical positions, but note that it has not resulted in upward pressure on wages. Selling prices are holding steady, although half of responding firms observe less discounting pressure currently than in Q4 2010; in fact, two contacts plan to raise prices modestly later this year. Capital and technology spending is mostly steady, with only two contacts reporting an increase in outlays. The outlook among software and IT services firms remains positive, with most expecting their current rate of growth to continue through the end of 2011.
boston|Staffing Services|2011|6|The majority of New England staffing contacts report that business conditions continue to improve, although a few have experienced stagnant or volatile activity over the past three months. Revenues are flat to increasing year-over-year, with increases from 3 percent to 35 percent. Labor demand continues to strengthen, with notable improvements in the information technology, medical, manufacturing, and legal sectors. However, a few contacts lament an elongated hiring cycle, with employers "still waiting for the perfect candidate." Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring continues to trend upwards-a sign that "things are heading in the right direction." Labor supply, at least at the high end, continues to be tight in the region. Bill rates and pay rates are steady, with most contacts reporting only modest changes. Looking forward, most New England staffing contacts are more positive than they were three and six months ago, predicting strong growth in the rest of 2011.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|6|Across the region, contacts report that commercial leasing activity remains modest, especially in the office sector where job growth has been tepid. The Hartford office market shows very light leasing activity and negligible absorption. In Providence, office leasing volume was also very light, but rents are said to be firming up. Office leasing activity in Boston is described as slow-to-moderate, and some say recent activity is slower than in the first quarter. Boston deals consist largely of tenant renewals, resulting in little net absorption. The biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sector in Boston is seen as comparatively dynamic, generating strong demand for office space in Cambridge and planned new construction in Boston's waterfront area. In Portland, activity is flat for the most part, although at least one significant office leasing deal was signed. Investor interest in apartments remains strong in Boston, with some contacts expressing concern that sales prices are getting too high; interest in prime office properties also strengthened in Boston. The lending environment for commercial real estate is described as increasingly favorable to borrowers. The outlook among contacts is cautiously optimistic. All expect at least slow growth in office and retail demand for the remainder of 2011 and some see potential for significant improvement in market conditions by early 2012, although a few mention risks posed by fiscal conditions and related political uncertainty at both the state and national levels.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|6|Residential real estate markets throughout New England experienced significant declines in sales and median prices in April compared to a year earlier. Contacts attribute the sales declines to the homebuyer tax credit, which boosted sales for the first half of last year. Condominium sales fell during the same period, and the median price of condos slipped across much of the region. Most contacts see job security as a significant hurdle in the recovery of the residential real estate market. Several contacts also note that stricter lending requirements among large banks have shrunk the potential pool of homebuyers. In general, contacts report that potential buyers are anticipating further price declines and sellers continue to price homes competitively in order to find a buyer quickly. While overall market activity remains weak, respondents see some improvement in the medium to high-end segments of the market.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|6|Consumer spending grew moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in March and April increased 2 percent compared with a year earlier. Sales and traffic have generally been higher than a year ago at a Montana mall, but were softer in mid-May. Sales and traffic are about even with a year ago at a South Dakota mall, according to the manager; cool weather seems to have slowed apparel sales. An auto dealers association in North Dakota forecasts a 10 percent increase in vehicle sales for 2011.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|6|Commercial construction activity increased in April. The value of commercial building permits in April increased from the same period a year earlier in both the Sioux Falls, S.D., and Fargo, N.D., areas. A data center in the Minneapolis area plans an expansion due to strong demand. Residential construction decreased from last year. The value of residential building permits in April dropped 27 percent from the same period a year earlier in the Sioux Falls area; in Minneapolis-St. Paul, the value of permits dropped significantly from a year ago.
minneapolis|Services|2011|6|Professional business services firms reported increased activity since the last report. Preliminary results of a mid-year business outlook poll by the Minneapolis Fed found that professional services respondents expect to increase sales and profits over the next year after gains during the past 12 months. The survey also revealed that access to bank credit over the past three months has improved, leading businesses to plan expansions and increase capital expenditures. An environmental consulting firm noted a strong increase in orders from the public sector and slight increases from the private sector. Information technology contacts noted an increase in activity over the past two months.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|6|activity increased since the last report. A May survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. A Sioux Falls manufacturer of electronics and aerospace products is expanding its operations. A bank director reported that manufacturers saw higher productivity and increased their equipment purchases.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|6|Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the last report. Late-May oil exploration activity increased from early April, and two natural gas processing plants are planned in North Dakota. Wind-energy development projects continued since the last report; however, a $400 million wind-power project in North Dakota was canceled because of potential threats to endangered birds. Iron ore mines in northern Minnesota are operating at full capacity. A mining company is in the early stages of exploring a potential $1.5 billion taconite mine and processing plant in northern Wisconsin. Metals prices remained strong, and Montana mines were operating at near capacity. A potential gold/zinc mine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is under consideration.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|6|District agricultural producers were hampered by continued poor weather conditions. Wet fields kept spring plantings of corn, wheat, soybeans and sugar beets well behind their five-year averages in late-May. Prices for most District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including corn, wheat, cattle, hogs, eggs and soybeans. Poultry prices were flat, and dairy prices decreased slightly. Of respondents to the Minneapolis Federal Reserve's first quarter (April) Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey, 83 percent reported increased farm incomes in the previous three months; 57 percent thought incomes would increase in the next three months.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|6|The job market continued to strengthen moderately since the last report. According to the preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's mid-year outlook poll, 30 percent expect to increase full-time employment at their firms over the next 12 months, while 22 percent will decrease staff. Some district companies reported difficulty finding workers to fill information technology jobs, certain health care occupations and skilled manufacturing positions. A North Dakota agricultural producer noted a short supply of qualified agricultural implement mechanics and technicians. An online retailer will add 200 jobs in North Dakota. In Minnesota, a communications firm announced plans to hire 450 workers for a new call center, a health care company will hire 100 more employees and a power generation firm will add 90 employees. In contrast, a defense contractor said it will close an operation affecting 100 workers, a meat producer will lay off 90 employees and a health care organization will lay off 70 workers.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|6|Reports from District factories indicate that production was stable or slightly up during the past six weeks, with a moderate rise in backlogs. A majority of our contacts maintain a favorable outlook, some of which was attributed to strength in offshore markets. However, several manufacturers said that market conditions are beginning to soften. Many steel producers and service centers reported that the rise in shipping volume seen in the first quarter is beginning to taper off, due in part to pricing issues and declines in consumer demand. Shipments are being driven by capital goods, autos, and energy-related industries. They anticipate volume remaining at current levels until a seasonal slowdown, which typically occurs during the third quarter. District auto production dropped sharply during April on a month-over-month and year-over-year basis. Most of the decline was due to supply disruptions caused by events in Japan.
cleveland|Real Estate|2011|6|New home construction remains at a very low level, with purchases mainly in the move-up buyer categories. The uptick in traffic and sales noted in our last report was not sustained. Two of our contacts told us that more interest exists in multi-family construction than single-family. Home builders do not expect the market to turn around any time soon, which they attributed to tight credit, a glut of houses on the market, and the fact it currently costs more per square foot to build a new house than to buy an existing house. List prices and discounting of new homes held steady, while some upward pressure on the cost of building materials was reported. Several builders said they want to construct more spec houses, but banks are unwilling to provide financing. Subcontractors are doing somewhat better due to facing less competition and taking on additional remodeling work. General contractors continue to work with lean crews, and no hiring is expected in the near term.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|6|Reports from retailers indicate that sales for the period from early April through mid-May rose in the low to mid-single digits and were generally on or ahead of plan. However, some of the increase was attributed to the rise in gasoline and food prices. Transactions were mostly higher relative to year-ago levels. Many of our contacts noted that rising sales included discretionary items. Looking forward, retailers are cautiously optimistic about third-quarter sales. We continue to hear about rising vendor prices, although they were mainly limited to food- and fuel-related products. Retailers passed through some of the increases to consumers. Reports on profit margins were mixed, with declines taken primarily by grocers. Capital outlays remain on plan and are slightly higher than year-ago levels. No change in payrolls is expected at existing stores.
cleveland|Banking|2011|6|Demand for business loans was stable or grew at a modest pace. Industries driving loan demand were broad-based, with a few of our contacts noting a pick up in construction loan requests for multi-family dwellings. On the consumer side, demand for home equity lines of credit and vehicle purchases (direct and indirect) remains strong, while activity in other installment loan categories was weak. Interest rates for business and consumer credit were stable, but competitive. Half of our contacts noted an uptick in the residential mortgage market, with activity equally distributed between refinancing and new purchases. Overall core deposits continue to grow, especially in demand accounts. The credit quality of business and consumer applicants was characterized as steady or improving. Delinquency rates were stable or trending down across loan portfolios, with the exception of real estate. Staffing levels have shown little change during the past few weeks, and about half of our respondents said that they expect some selective hiring to occur during 2011.
cleveland|Energy|2011|6|Reports indicate that oil and natural gas drilling and production held steady during the past six weeks, with little change expected in the near term. Wellhead prices paid to independent producers were flat for natural gas and continued on a modest upward trend for oil. Coal production was stable to moderately lower since our last report, with little change anticipated for the remainder of the year. Spot prices for coal, especially metallurgical, are moving higher, which was attributed in part to a rise in transportation costs. We heard several reports of increased prices for diesel fuel, equipment, parts, and materials used in coal production. Severe spring weather in the Midwest is interfering with coal shipments to utilities and exports from New Orleans.  payrolls are expected to remain at current levels.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|6|Freight transport executives reported that shipping volume expanded for a broad range of manufactured goods, and they expect markets will continue to grow in the upcoming months. Several contacts told us that they are attempting to raise their shipping prices as customer contracts come up for renewal, and they are seeing a slight bottom-line improvement. The price for diesel fuel remains elevated, with most of the increase being passed through to customers via surcharges. We also heard several reports about rising costs associated with recent changes in environmental and federal safety regulations. Capital outlays are expected to accelerate during 2011, if financing can be obtained. Spending will be mainly for replacement, although some additions to capacity have been announced. Hiring has been for driver replacement, seasonal work, and maintenance mechanics. Wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|6|Most District merchants signaled a deceleration in sales in April and May after moderate increases earlier in the year. Retailers said that periodic adverse weather conditions and high gasoline prices combined to dampen sales across the District. Contacts reported that they continued to manage inventories tightly. The outlook among District retailers remained optimistic. Auto dealers noted both declining inventories and firm demand.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|6|District homebuilders indicated that new home sales and construction remained at very low levels in April and May. Several Alabama builders reported that in many areas repairs and rebuilding from the April tornado damage was underway.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|6|District manufacturers noted an increase in new orders and production in April and May. The majority of contacts planned to increase production in the short-term. The exceptions were auto producers and parts suppliers that experienced input constraints stemming from the Japanese earthquake. However, these contacts reported that lost production would be made up later in the year as supply channels returned to normal. District ports reported increased volumes in cargo and shipments. Air cargo contacts noted that tonnage was returning to near pre-recession levels. Railway firms cited strong increases in exports of chemicals, coal, and other energy-related products to China and India. The flooding of the Mississippi River is not expected to cause long-term disruptions to maritime traffic.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|6|Businesses outside of the construction and real estate segments reported a slight improvement in credit availability. Banking contacts remarked that business loan demand had improved modestly, but new firms had difficulty qualifying for credit because of their inability to meet cash flow requirements. Bankers indicated that consumer loan demand remained flat as consumers continued to pay down equity and consolidate debt. Credit availability for auto loans continued to improve. Some firms continued to rely on cash reserves for capital expenditures and expansions. District banks also noted an increase in credit requests from agriculture customers.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|6|Labor markets continued to improve gradually across the District. Most business contacts planned to either increase staff levels or leave them unchanged. Firms that plan to increase employment were doing so in response to increased demand and because they have maximized productivity with their existing staff. Staffing agencies continued to experience high demand for temporary workers as well as an increase in temp-to-hire positions. Some contacts reported difficulty finding qualified candidates to fill specialized, higher skilled positions, especially in healthcare and communications/technology sectors. Firms that are not increasing employment cited high operating costs and uncertainty about future demand as constraints to hiring plans.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|6|The number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico is at roughly half the pre-Gulf of Mexico oil spill level. Several energy infrastructure manufacturing firms noted an increase in capital investment. The Mississippi River flooding has caused minor disruption to river traffic, which, in turn, may affect production in some oil refineries and chemical plants. The interruptions are expected to be short-lived, and there are no reports of damage to transportation or energy infrastructure.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|6|Retail sales have held steady since the last report and are running modestly above comparable 2010 levels. Sales were somewhat ahead of plan, despite unseasonably cool and wet weather, which likely had a small negative effect on spending. Two contacts--a major retail chain and a large mall in upstate New York--report that sales weakened in the first half of May, after a robust April. Inventories are reported to be in good shape. Selling prices have been steady overall, though some contacts describe the pricing environment as more promotional than a year ago. One major retail chain indicates that prices have been stable during the first half of the year; yet moderate price increases are planned for the second half of 2011--largely for cotton-based merchandise.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|6|Housing markets across the District have been mixed since the last report: the home purchase market has been steady to somewhat softer, but the rental market has continued to strengthen. Buffalo-area Realtors report steady market conditions, with sales activity and pending sales down from a year earlier but prices up roughly 5 percent. More broadly, home prices have been running moderately ahead of a year earlier across most of upstate New York, despite pockets of weakness in metropolitan Rochester and Albany. However, prices in the New York City metropolitan area, including northern New Jersey and southwestern Connecticut, have drifted down slightly and are modestly lower than a year ago.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|6|Reports from business contacts give a mixed picture of the labor market. A major New York City employment agency reports that, after a robust March, hiring activity weakened noticeably in April and early May, though it picked up again in the third week of May. Still, the supply of available workers has dwindled further, and more workers are testing the water and leaving current jobs for new ones. Starting salaries have remained steady and below pre-recession levels. Law firms, in particular, have started hiring more, while financial sector hiring has been stable. A contact in the securities industry reports that the jobs being added there tend to be mostly in support areas, such as legal and compliance, as opposed to revenue-generating areas.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|6|Reports on loan demand were mixed: small to medium sized banks indicate a decrease in demand for consumer loans, an increase in demand for commercial mortgages, and no change in the demand for residential mortgages and commercial and industrial loans. Respondents indicate no change in credit standards for the household sector but a tightening of standards for commercial loans and especially commercial mortgages. Bankers report a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly on residential mortgages. There were also fairly widespread decreases in deposit rates. Finally, delinquency rates rose for consumer loans but decreased for commercial mortgages and, to a lesser extent, on commercial and industrial loans. Delinquency rates on residential mortgages were unchanged.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|6|Consumer spending increased at a slower rate than during the previous reporting period. Retailers reported that sales were mostly flat. Higher food and energy prices caused consumers to make fewer shopping trips and purchase fewer discretionary items. Auto sales edged up, as higher demand for passenger cars offset a slight decline in sales of trucks and SUVs. Auto dealers reported that their inventory levels of small passenger cars were starting to come under pressure due to higher than anticipated demand for fuel efficient vehicles and production disruptions related to the situation in Japan. Dealers of Japanese vehicles expect that supply problems will continue to affect their inventory levels for the remainder of the year. These supply constraints were noted to be causing used car prices to rise, as well as benefitting passenger vehicle sales of the Detroit automakers. Quality improvements were also said to have put the Detroit 3 in a better competitive position.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|6|Business spending increased at a steady pace in April and May. Inventories were little changed on balance. However, a few manufacturers in the auto industry said they had increased inventories to guard against potential future supply disruptions stemming from the situation in Japan. Contacts indicated that capital expenditures were proceeding as planned, with some manufacturers reporting a slight increase in capacity. There also was a pick-up in merger and acquisition activity in the manufacturing sector. Labor market conditions improved with continued strength in manufacturing, where contacts again cited a shortage of qualified applicants for highly skilled trades. A large staffing firm reported that billable hours ticked up and permanent placement activity continued to increase. However, demand for temporary workers softened in some regional labor markets and remained slow in some industries, such as finance.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2011|6|Construction activity was again subdued in April and May. Single-family home construction continued to be constrained by the overhang of distressed properties in the resale market. However, existing home sales picked up in parts of the District, lowering the inventory of unsold homes to a degree. In the multifamily sector, the rental market continued to improve. Residential rents rose further, and credit has become increasingly more available for the purchase of apartment buildings. With minimal single-family and condo development planned in the District, contacts expect to see an increase in the construction of apartments in the near future. Nonresidential construction edged up with stronger demand from the automotive industry, small retail projects, and renovation. Contacts indicated that while more private sector building projects are coming up for bid, stiff competition continues to put downward pressure on pricing. Furthermore, while public sector projects remain a source of strength, they are becoming smaller. Commercial real estate conditions were little changed, with vacancy rates steady and landlords keeping commercial rents low to maintain occupancy at existing levels.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|6|production growth slowed from the previous reporting period, although contacts expected the recent slowdown would be temporary with conditions expected to rebound in the coming months. Capacity utilization in the steel industry was only marginally lower; and while other manufacturers of industrial metals noted a softening in orders for second quarter delivery, several also indicated that order books for third quarter delivery were more positive. A contact speculated that the recent volatility in industrial metals prices was leading some customers to delay orders, expecting lower surcharges in the coming months and to avoid getting caught holding inventory at elevated prices. Manufacturers of construction materials and household goods also reported a decline in activity. In contrast, orders for heavy trucks, agricultural and construction equipment were up. Fleet replacement and robust activity in oil and gas extraction were cited as reasons for the continued strength in demand for heavy equipment. Supply chain disruptions reduced activity in the automotive sector, but mostly for the Japanese automakers and their suppliers. District automakers were able to avoid the most severe dislocations by reallocating parts to vehicles that are in high demand and implementing contingency plans for alternative supply sources. Contacts indicated that while it remains to be seen how effective these measures will be over an extended period, these supply chain adjustments were occurring at a faster rate than previously expected. In addition, a contact noted that some automakers and their suppliers are moving planned summer shutdowns forward into June to give supply chains time to repair and thus be in better position for a ramp up in production in the third quarter.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|6|Credit conditions continued to improve in April and May. Corporate funding costs for a number of large firms in the District decreased, and contacts noted that liquidity in corporate credit markets remains ample. Banking contacts reported a slight increase in business loan demand. Although much of this continued to be refinancing of existing debt, contacts noted that they were starting to see more new commercial and industrial loans in the pipeline. Credit availability, however, remained an issue for some small business borrowers. A contact noted that larger banks have recently begun to return to small business lending, but that the loan capacity of community banks who have traditionally serviced this segment is still impaired. Outside of banking, conditions in the municipal bond market improved and there was an increase in investment activity by hedge funds, venture capital firms and other forms of private equity.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|6|Cost pressures increased in April before subsiding some in May. Food and energy prices ended the period mostly lower, as did prices for steel, copper, and other industrial metals. Despite the recent declines, commodity prices remain elevated, and surcharges for fuel, metals, and other commodities increased significantly during the reporting period. Lead times also continued to be longer than normal, and shortages of some raw materials were reported. Pass-through of higher costs to prices further downstream remained moderate. Retailers reported that they were unable to pass along much of the recent increase in wholesale prices; and in many cases, were trying to compensate for the impact of higher food and energy prices on consumer budgets by increasing promotions and discounts. Retail contacts also noted that margins were tight, particularly for grocery stores, and further increases in costs would likely need to be passed along. Wage pressures remained moderate.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|6|Corn and soybean planting lagged the pace of last spring in the District, as excess precipitation and cool temperatures slowed field work. Planting conditions were best in Iowa and Illinois, where planted acres had caught up to five-year averages after a slow start. The emergence of corn and soybean plants was behind normal, except in Iowa. The poor start to the growing season reduces the yield potential of the District corn crop. Even so, there is still the chance of a very large crop. Agricultural commodity markets were choppy during the reporting period. After peaking earlier this year, corn, soybean, and wheat prices ended down. Cattle and milk prices edged lower, while hog prices edged up.
dallas|Prices|2011|6|Price pressures remain elevated, according to most responding firms in the Eleventh District. Many manufacturers said they had raised prices since the last report, but not enough to offset raw material cost increases, leaving margins squeezed. Several responding firms said price increases were becoming necessary to cover previous upticks in fuel, freight and or raw materials prices. Most construction-related manufacturing firms either planned or had implemented selling price increases; and construction firms expected cost increases to stick, noting producers of construction-related products could no longer absorb higher energy and freight costs. Several service sector companies reported increased ability to raise prices during the past six weeks. Most said the increases were necessary to cover previous increases in fuel, freight and/or raw materials prices. Higher demand for accounting-advisory services has resulted in price increases. Agricultural contacts said crop prices had fallen slightly but remain at relatively high levels. Retailers said prices increased modestly over the past six weeks, and most expected their selling prices to remain elevated due to increases in input prices and transportation costs.
dallas|Labor Market|2011|6|Employment levels rose or held steady at most responding firms. There were increased reports of hiring activity compared with the previous reporting period. Most staffing firms noted strong demand at stable levels. Contacts in financial services, auto sales, construction and related materials, and transportation manufacturing reported hiring increases. Some high-tech manufacturers noted an increase in employment for skilled workers. Wage pressures were slightly higher, with increases reported by some accounting and finance firms. Moreover, high-tech respondents noted compensation was increasing due to the return of bonuses that had been temporarily halted during the recession.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|6|Most construction-related manufacturers noted a pick-up in demand since the last report. Some of the uptick was seasonal and expected, but several contacts said that it was difficult to separate out seasonal demand from improved business conditions. Public projects still account for a large share of orders, but contacts said demand had increased because of an acceleration in private projects such as apartment and commercial buildings. The one exception was the lumber industry, where responses mostly reflected weaker conditions over the past six weeks.
dallas|Retail Sales|2011|6|Retail activity increased moderately over the reporting period. Looking at March and April and smoothing out fluctuations due to the Easter holiday, demand has increased in the low- to mid-single digits over the prior year. Some contacts mentioned gasoline prices as a concern but the effects of elevated prices have been limited thus far. Texas continues to perform above the national average, according to one large retailer, and the outlook for 2011 remains positive.
dallas|Non-financial Services|2011|6|Staffing firms reported growth in orders has leveled off or slowed slightly since the last report, although demand remains strong, particularly from the energy, healthcare, insurance and banking sectors. Outlooks are positive, and contacts expect demand to remain stable through year-end. Demand for accounting services increased since the last report, as is typical for this time of year. Improved demand has helped firms raise fees for advisory services. Legal firms noted mostly steady demand, with some strength in corporate, intellectual property litigation, and real estate services.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|6|Financial firms reported steady overall loan demand. Large banks with a national footprint reported some pickup in commercial and industrial loan demand with increased corporate activity, and commercial real estate (CRE) activity has shown recent improvement as well. Regional banks noted that loan demand remains pretty flat, although optimism persists for pockets of homebuilding and some CRE lending across the state. Demand for auto and consumer loans declined. Contacts continue to note that loan pricing remains aggressive amidst a highly competitive lending landscape. Outlooks are generally positive in light of better outstanding loan quality and continued slow improvement in lending conditions.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2011|6|Eleventh District housing contacts said sales remain at low levels, but optimism has increased along with better traffic. Sales are expected to improve in the second half of 2011. As reported in previous reports, sales in the higher price points continue to improve. Apartment demand continues to accelerate, and rents have edged up since the last report.
dallas|Energy|2011|6|Drilling activity is very strong and growing, according to responding firms in the energy industry. A majority of wells being drilled in the United States are directed to oil for the first time since May 1995. Contacts noted Texas is leading the expansion of domestic activity, with strong activity in the Permian basin and Eagle Ford Shale. While the majority of activity is land-based, work is being re-permitted in the Gulf of Mexico, and service firms noted they are moving workers back into the Gulf area. Respondents also noted that international work continues to grow.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|6|The entire Eleventh District is experiencing drought conditions, and the severity has progressed considerably. About half of the district is now in exceptional drought, the most severe drought classification, up from zero percent at the last report. The outlook for the wheat crop is poor and it is likely that the cotton harvest will be down from last year. Numerous wildfires have led to an estimated $20.4 million in agricultural losses.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2011|6|Contacts reported that retail sales in April and early May were up, on average, over year-earlier levels. About 48 percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 36 percent saw decreases and 16 percent saw no changes. Roughly 41 percent of the retailers noted that sales levels were below their expectations, 35 percent reported that sales met expectations, and 24 percent reported that sales were above expectations. About 32 percent of the retailers noted that their inventories were too high, while 20 percent reported that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook for June and July was mostly optimistic: About 60 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2010 levels, while 24 percent expect sales to decrease and 16 percent expect sales to be similar to last year.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|6|Manufacturing activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or reduce operations. Firms in the tire, powder coating, food, paper, packaging, machinery, automobile, and ship manufacturing industries reported plans to expand existing operations and hire new workers. In contrast, a firm in paper manufacturing announced plans to close a plant and lay off employees. Additionally, some automobile manufacturers have reduced their production because of a shortage of parts sourced from Japan.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|6|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, April 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 11 percent in Louisville and Memphis and 19 percent in St. Louis and Little Rock. Residential construction also continued to decrease throughout the District. April 2011 year-to-date single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 33 percent in Little Rock, 42 percent in St. Louis, and 25 percent in Memphis and Louisville.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|6|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks indicates little variation in overall lending activity in the first quarter of 2011 relative to the fourth quarter of 2010. During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were unchanged, while demand ranged from unchanged to moderately weaker. Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans remained unchanged, while demand ranged from about the same to moderately stronger. Credit standards for residential mortgage loans ranged from unchanged to somewhat tighter, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to moderately stronger.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|6|Heavy rain and flooding on the Mississippi River during April and early May slowed down field work and affected crop conditions in the District. The rates of completion for the planting of corn, cotton, rice, sorghum, and soybeans were behind their 5-year average in most District states; crop emergence was generally behind schedule as well. At least 67 percent of the winter wheat crop was rated in fair or better condition across the District states. Similarly, 88 percent or more of pastures were rated in fair or better condition. Monthly coal production for April 2011 was 2.6 percent lower compared with April 2010.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|6|Reports of widespread, robust demand growth for manufactured products as of the last Beige Book gave way to two months of easing in the breadth and pace of recovery. Less than 30 percent of Third District manufacturers reported increases in shipments and orders in May -- slipping from over 50 percent since the last Beige Book. Among key manufacturing sectors in the Third District, the number reporting increases of both shipments and orders narrowed to 7 from 13 since the last Beige Book. The strongest reports of orders came from producers of chemicals; food; stone, clay, and glass; and fabricated metal products. Since the last Beige Book, declines in orders broadened from producers of apparel and rubber products to include producers of electronic equipment and instruments. Failure to pass a multiyear transportation infrastructure reauthorization bill and the ongoing real estate slump were cited by five different manufacturing sectors as hampering the recovery.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|6|Third District retailers generally reported small year-over-year increases in sales in May, although results varied by store type. Discount stores and some luxury goods retailers posted better increases than mid-price retailers and department stores. ers said sales of spring apparel have been held back by cool, rainy weather. Several merchants said that high gasoline prices were deterring shopping trips and constraining consumers' discretionary buying. Looking ahead, store executives expect just slow growth in sales. One merchant's comment expressed the general opinion: "The consumer is responding to value. Only confidence in the job situation will prompt broader buying."
philadelphia|Finance|2011|6|Third District banks contacted in May gave mixed reports on loan volume outstanding. Some posted increases in consumer and business loans, but others reported drops in these categories since the last Beige Book. On balance, total credit extended by banks in the region has been flat in recent weeks. Although some bankers have had recent increases in loan demand from small and medium businesses, most said demand for credit from this sector has been weak. "Loan demand hasn't moved at all," one said, even as competition among lenders has increased. Most of the banks surveyed in May indicated that credit quality has been improving, although some said the pace of improvement has been slow. Looking ahead, the general view among the region's bankers is that loan demand will move up slightly, at best, in the near future.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|6|Residential real estate activity has picked up since the previous Beige Book in most parts of the Third District, according to residential real estate agents contacted for this report. Agents continued to note that the sales pace has been relatively stronger for middle- and low-price homes and weaker for high-price homes. Agents attributed the improved sales pace to the usual seasonal gain and buyers' concern that mortgage loan rates are likely to increase in the future. Looking ahead, residential real estate agents expect sales for this year as a whole to be level with last year. An agent who remarked that "we are off the bottom, but it's going to be a slow comeback" expressed a common opinion. Residential agents generally reported flat to slightly falling house prices for existing homes. New homebuilders indicated that these lower existing home sales prices further reduced their customer traffic in May. While they see more committed buyers among the traffic, overall demand for new homes remains flat.
philadelphia|Services|2011|6|Third District service-sector firms contacted for this report generally described demand for their services as growing modestly. Business-service firms noted some increased activity as a result of both greater usage by current clients and demand from new client companies. An executive at a business-service firm said, "Our activity in cyclical sectors is starting to improve." Contacts in the transportation sector reported some recent easing in the slow, steady growth rate that held for the first four months of the year. Contacts in engineering and architectural services reported slight gains in current activity and a somewhat stronger upturn in inquiries. Most of the service-sector firms polled in May expect growth to continue at around its recent pace.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|6|Since the previous Beige Book, nearly half of all manufacturers reported rising factor prices, especially for energy and commodities, but less than half of those firms are able to pass costs through to their customers. However, imposition of fuel surcharges by service firms in the region has increased. Retailers generally indicated that selling prices have been steady, except for food products and some petroleum-based products and imports. Retailers noted that consumers continue to favor lower price-point merchandise, and stores are continuing to alter merchandise selection to include more of those items.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|6|Consumer spending was generally described as steady to up modestly since the last report, with most Districts indicating small increases from a year ago. Non-auto retail sales were indicated to be expanding steadily in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while sales were characterized as stable or decelerating in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Sales were reported to have declined in the Richmond District, and Boston described sales as mixed but generally down from a year earlier. Retail inventories were generally said to be at satisfactory levels, though St. Louis characterized inventory levels as being on the high side. A number of Districts noted that a combination of unfavorable weather and high fuel and food prices have weighed on consumer spending in recent weeks. Cleveland and San Francisco noted increased spending on discretionary items, and Philadelphia indicated that some luxury goods retailers fared relatively well. On the other hand, Chicago reported a decline in discretionary spending.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|6|Activity in the non-financial service sectors continued to strengthen in most Districts, with the notable exception of St. Louis, which reported fairly widespread declines. Service sector activity generally expanded in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, though Richmond noted deceleration in the pace of growth. There were also pockets of strength in particular sectors. Information technology firms saw activity expand in the Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Employment agencies in the Boston and Chicago Districts indicated continued improvement in activity, while New York and Dallas reported some slowing in this industry. New York, Richmond and Minneapolis cited strengthening in business and professional services, while San Francisco indicated steady to mixed activity in this sector.
summary|Manufacturing|2011|6|activity was reported as continuing to increase since the last report in all but two districts, although many noted that the pace of growth had slowed. The Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, Districts reported that activity expanded, and the Dallas District reported a pickup in demand; the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts reported that activity expanded but at a slower pace, while activity was reported as steady in the New York District and stable to growing in the Cleveland District. Supply disruptions related to the earthquake in Japan led to reduced production of automobiles and auto parts in several Districts. The Cleveland District noted a sharp drop in auto production, the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts also saw production fall, and auto deliveries were reported as having declined in the Richmond District. The Atlanta District said lost production in its region would be made up later in the year. Contacts in the Chicago District said that contingency plans to deal with supply disruptions were helpful in mitigating the effects. High-tech firms in the Boston and Dallas Districts reported that shortages of parts, due to disruptions in Japan, had adverse effects on business; in contrast, there were few supply constraints that affected technology-related products in the San Francisco District.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|6|Residential real estate sales markets showed continued weakness in most Districts, while rental markets strengthened. Most Districts indicate that home prices have declined since the last report: Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco all report some downward drift in selling prices, while reports from the New York and Cleveland Districts indicate that prices have been steady, on balance. No district indicates a general increase in home prices. Sales activity, though widely reported to be at low levels, picked up somewhat in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Dallas indicated that improved traffic has raised prospects of improved sales in the second half of 2011, and Boston observed signs that the market is stabilizing. Sales activity was characterized as mostly steady in the New York, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, but declining in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts. Those Districts reporting on the residential rental market--specifically, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco--all indicate that conditions have strengthened. In terms of residential construction, activity has remained generally depressed, with a number of Districts reporting a large overhang of distressed properties. However, a number of Districts--New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco--report improved prospects for development of multi-family rental properties.
summary|Banking and Finance|2011|6|Most Districts described loan demand as mixed or slightly improved since the last report. Consumer loan demand showed some improvement in the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts, but held steady or weakened in the New York, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Demand for residential mortgages (including new purchases and refinances) increased in Cleveland but held steady in New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted a modest uptick in business loan demand. The increase in business loan demand in Cleveland was described as broad-based, including a pickup in construction loan requests for multi-family dwellings. Boston noted an improved lending environment for commercial real estate, and demand for commercial mortgages increased in New York and Dallas. Commercial and industrial loan activity increased in Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, held steady in New York, and decreased in Kansas City. Outside of banking, Chicago and San Francisco indicated increased investment activity by hedge funds, venture capital firms, and other forms of private equity.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|6|Agriculture conditions were unfavorable in many districts, with various weather related difficulties leading to delays and below-average plantings of key crops. Excess precipitation and cool temperatures delayed the planting of corn, soybeans, and other crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, although Richmond reported that some parts of its District benefited from favorable weather conditions. Cool temperatures also delayed the development of some crops in the San Francisco District. Flooding on the Mississippi River slowed activity for farmers in the St. Louis and Atlanta Districts. The Dallas District reported that drought conditions had become severe and that the wheat crop was expected to be particularly poor; wildfires also led to significant agricultural losses in its District. Commodity prices were reported as strong in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, but were down in the Chicago District. Hog prices were higher in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, while cattle prices were reported as lower in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts but higher in the Minneapolis and Atlanta Districts.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|6|Most Districts reported gradual improvement in labor market conditions since their last reports. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all noted general improvement in employment conditions, while job growth was mostly limited to the manufacturing sector in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts. Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring increased in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. While labor was generally available, contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated that labor market conditions have tightened for workers with specialized technical skills, particularly in the healthcare and technology sectors. Despite signs of continued modest improvement in most labor markets, Minneapolis noted several examples of expected layoffs and St. Louis reported plans for layoffs in the District's services sector.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|6|District manufacturing cooled in May after expanding for seven months. Several textile and apparel contacts described their business as being unpredictable, with "very little depth." Similarly, a producer of coated steels mentioned that, although the first quarter had been fairly strong, order volume had been going down since then. Also, a supplier of specialty materials reported that his business had leveled off in recent weeks because demand for his customers' goods had slowed. Several contacts stated that the disruptions in Japan had affected automotive deliveries, due to lack of electronic components and paints. Firms reported that their customers were strongly resisting any price increases, despite knowing that commodity prices were rising. Our latest manufacturing survey revealed that prices of raw materials rose notably over the last month, but prices of finished goods were up only moderately.
richmond|Retail|2011|6|sales generally slowed since our last report. Several firms attributed the slowdown to higher gasoline prices. A central Virginia retailer noted that, even though consumer confidence was good in the area, buying behavior was "tentative, as customers' needs were superseding their wants," driving stores to compete aggressively on price. Apparel and general merchandise retailers reported soft sales, and a large bookseller in central North Carolina stated that sales had weakened over the last month. In contrast, a store manager at a big box discount store in Virginia Beach said sales had improved in the last month and that the store was hiring again. Most auto dealers that we contacted cited flat-to-stronger sales, despite scattered reports of inventory or parts shortages caused by the Japanese crisis. Grocery sales remained solid, and several contacts reported passing through price increases to their customers. A number of surveyed wholesalers reported faster revenue growth in recent weeks. Durable goods wholesalers generally noted a pick-up in revenues despite the reported ongoing slump in retailers' big-ticket sales.  prices edged up, and wages were little changed.
richmond|Services|2011|6|Contacts at non-retail services firms reported somewhat slower revenue growth in recent weeks. Executives at several healthcare facilities noted flat demand for services over the last month. One hospital administrator also expressed uncertainty about the financial effect on his hospital of the increase in "newly insured" populations under healthcare reform. He noted significant challenges for smaller, rural hospitals with respect to information technology investments needed to secure federal matching opportunities. In contrast, professional, scientific, and technical firms that we survey reported slightly quicker revenue growth. Price growth at services firms was mild, while wage increases were widespread. A healthcare system executive in central Virginia reported that salary pressures were being driven by shortages in some specialties.
richmond|Finance|2011|6|Lending activity posted modest but broad-based gains across the District over the last few months. Commercial and industrial lending expanded, especially for capital equipment and storage facilities. Several community bankers also cited increasing loan demand from small businesses. These borrowers had new orders from large manufacturers, who were subcontracting to keep up with demand. Consumers were starting to use credit cards again, according to several lenders, and were increasingly seeking financing for autos and home improvements. However, a contact at a large bank in North Carolina reported making very few home equity loans, and most bankers reported seeing little new mortgage lending activity. Most lenders cited improvement in their balance sheet quality, with delinquencies and charge-offs down markedly.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|6|Residential real estate agents in the Fifth District gave varied reports. An agent in the D.C. area described the housing market as "terrific," noting that April produced the highest number of sales since June 2005, with the exception of last March and April, when sales were boosted by the first-time buyer program. In Richmond, however, a contact mentioned that unit sales had dropped quite a bit, along with foot traffic. Sales in the lower-price range were reported as faring much better than sales in the upper ranges. A Realtor in Richmond said that sales of homes in the $400,000 to $1 million price range had increased compared to a year ago. He pointed out, however, that sales were contingent on the houses being in perfect condition, with extremely competitive pricing. While most contacts reported that they had not seen any change in the proportion of distressed sales, one agent noticed an increase of short sales and stated that the entire short sale process remained a major issue for buyers. On balance, most contacts said that transaction prices had either flattened or continued to decline.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|6|Labor conditions were flat to slightly stronger since our last report. Several employment agents were upbeat, but noted localized areas of softness in demand across the District. Some employment agents indicated that they were placing more permanent workers than they were a year ago. However, a branch manager of one agency in Raleigh said that some manufacturing clients remained cautious about hiring decisions due to the instability of incoming orders. A Hagerstown agent said, "Growth is not surging forward quite as much as a few months ago, but we are still seeing growth in demand compared to a year ago." He noted, however, that gains were somewhat uneven because the demand for extra workers seemed to come and go within short time frames, indicating volatility in his clients' own sales and production. Retailers made few hiring changes in recent weeks, following an extended period of payroll cuts, according to recent survey participants. However, the store manager at a chain discounter in North Carolina remarked that a local manufacturer had begun recalling laid-off workers, which included some store employees; because the manufacturing wages were more attractive than what he could offer well-qualified applicants, he will cover the vacancies with more hours for seasonal workers. Services providers continued to add employees, although the overall pace of hiring in the sector slowed from a month ago.
richmond|Tourism|2011|6|in the District continued to show signs of improvement in recent weeks. Airport contacts in Maryland and Virginia reported strong business travel since our last report. In addition, recreational industries, restaurants, and hotels noted stronger revenue growth, according to our contacts. A contact on the North Carolina coastline told us that tourist activity had increased compared to year-ago levels, and house rentals were up as much as 20 percent or higher in the last few weeks. A tourism contact in Washington, D.C. reported that the number of incoming tour buses was unusually high, and the nation's capital expected more than 500,000 tourists on Memorial Day weekend.
richmond|Agriculture|2011|6|Rain and below-average temperatures hindered cotton planting in South Carolina and delayed corn and soybean planting in parts of Virginia and West Virginia. In contrast, cotton planting was almost complete in Virginia and planting of peanuts was progressing on schedule. In Maryland and Virginia, vegetable growers continued to plant summer crops and harvesting of greens and strawberries was well underway. Moreover, an analyst in Maryland noted that a large amount of good quality hay had been cut and baled, due to good drying conditions. In addition, pastures continued to green-up. Lastly, peach conditions in South Carolina and West Virginia ranged from fair to excellent, with most orchards in good condition.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|6|Consumer spending continued to grow solidly, and most contacts expected further growth in the months ahead. Retail sales accelerated and nearly all retail contacts reported that sales were above year-ago levels. Sales of apparel and seasonal garden supplies were noted as particularly strong, while a few contacts characterized sales of appliance and some high-end items as weak. Store inventories edged higher, but most stores were satisfied with current stock levels. Auto sales continued to increase, but the pace slowed somewhat from the previous survey. Auto inventories declined further, and several dealers reported additional supply constraints due to the natural disaster in Japan. Restaurant sales were strong, and travel and tourism activity remained favorable. Most restaurant and tourism contacts expected solid activity heading forward.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|6|Growth in District manufacturing activity slowed following rapid growth in recent months, while other business activity expanded further. Factory orders declined after surging earlier in the spring, but factory hiring continued at solid rates and firms remained relatively optimistic about future sales. Growth in transportation activity accelerated from the previous survey, and most firms reported optimism about future sales. The majority of high-tech services firms reported strong growth in sales, though the pace slowed a bit from the previous month. Capital spending plans improved for transportation companies, and high-tech and manufacturing firms also reported fairly solid plans for future expenditures.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|6|Residential and commercial real estate activity was stable but still generally slow. The decline in housing starts leveled off in May, and new home construction activity was similar to year-ago levels. Expectations for future homebuilding improved from the previous survey, and materials were generally available. Residential construction supply firms reported an uptick in sales, partly driven by demand for storm related items such as roofing and decking materials. Home sales were higher than the previous month but lower than a year ago. Expectations for future home sales were modestly positive, but home inventories climbed higher and home prices continued to edge down in most areas. Mortgage lending activity improved from the previous survey but was well below year-ago levels, particularly for refinancing activity. Commercial real estate activity was mostly flat, though it was slightly stronger than a year ago and contacts had a more positive outlook for future months. Vacancy and absorption rates were steady but expected to improve. Office prices and rents declined and were below year-ago levels in most cities. One contact noted continued obstacles in financing, and another firm said projects have decreased in overall size.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|6|Bankers reported generally stable loan demand, increased deposits, and improvements in loan quality. Overall loan demand was stable to slightly lower in some cases. Demand for commercial and residential real estate loans was generally unchanged, while demand for commercial and industrial loans and consumer installment loans decreased. Credit standards largely remained unchanged in all major loan categories. Deposits increased for the third straight survey. Bankers reported improvements in loan quality compared to a year ago, and the outlook for loan quality was more favorable. The majority of bankers expected bank employment to remain unchanged over the next year, citing low expected growth, cost constraints, and uncertainty about regulations and government policies as the major reasons restraining hiring plans.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|6|activity continued to expand strongly in May. Nearly all contacts reported an increase in drilling activity and were optimistic about the months ahead. Crude oil prices remained elevated and favorable for drilling, and natural gas activity rebounded somewhat with a recent uptick in prices. Contacts reported that shortages of equipment and labor continued to somewhat restrain the rate of increase in drilling activity. Several companies have expanded their capital expenditure plans, mainly for projects directed towards drilling and exploration.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|6|Rising farm income spurred record high farmland values and cash rental rates. Crop prices rose further with higher export demand, especially from China. Record pork exports bolstered hog prices, but increased cow slaughter and weaker than usual demand for grilling cuts dampened cattle prices. Many producers used cash rather than debt to pay for higher input costs, and farm equipment sales remained robust. Agricultural growing conditions varied in May. Recent heavy rains held up the start of the winter wheat harvest with early reports of below-average yields in drought-stricken areas. Despite planting delays due to wet fields, the corn and soybean crops were progressing normally.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|6|Price levels generally rose at a slower rate in May, and wage pressures were mostly contained despite solid hiring plans. Manufacturing price increases remained common, but with some slowdown in materials price increases and with fewer firms planning to raise selling prices. Construction supply firms also reported a moderation in selling price increases, but builder input prices were considerably higher than the previous survey. Retail prices increased further and were expected to continue rising in future months. Transportation firms reported an increase in input prices, and restaurants said menu prices were well above year-ago levels. Wage pressures were still contained in most industries. However, some firms reported difficulties finding skilled workers and were forced to raise wages, particularly in information technology fields. Hiring plans have improved for most firms, particularly those in the energy, information technology, health-care, and manufacturing sectors.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|7|Upward price pressures were limited during the reporting period. Price declines were noted for oil and selected raw materials such as aluminum. Furthermore, modest demand and stiff competition continued to hold down final prices for most retail goods and services, although food prices remained quite elevated. Looking ahead, contacts in most sectors anticipate that prices for their products will remain largely stable to slightly up through the end of the year, with larger gains expected for apparel.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|7|Retail sales were mixed. Sales were largely flat for discount chains, while traditional department stores, particularly those catering to the luxury segment of the market, noted ongoing sales gains. Similarly, retailers of big-ticket items such as major appliances and furniture reported modest sales increases since the prior reporting period. Grocery sales remained largely flat. Sales of new automobiles declined, as lingering supply chain disruptions associated with the natural disaster in Japan earlier this year significantly reduced dealer inventories. In response to the shortage of new vehicles, dealer demand for used vehicles ramped up, further bolstering sales prices and trade-in values.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|7|District manufacturing activity strengthened a bit further during the reporting period of June through mid-July. Production rates remained near capacity for makers of commercial aircraft and parts. Demand improved modestly for manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, with reports pointing to high levels of capacity utilization, continued growth in sales, and inventories that were at or near desired levels given the pace of sales. Production activity and sales improved somewhat for metal fabricators, with gains in foreign demand more than offsetting weak domestic demand. Similarly, capacity utilization rates remained largely stable for petroleum refiners, as export growth for gasoline and distillate products helped to reduce inventories. Demand continued to be especially weak for wood product manufacturers, with the exception of the pulp and paper sector, which has seen sustained increases in orders.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|7|Demand continued to grow for agricultural products, and it expanded further on net for mined products and natural resources used for energy production. Final sales and orders were robust and continued to grow for a range of crop and livestock products. Contacts generally noted stable input costs and supply conditions, although wildfires in Arizona caused widespread destruction of grazing land, prompting ranchers to reduce their stocks and causing sharp financial losses in some cases. Mining activity in parts of the District expanded further in response to elevated prices for an assortment of metals. Strong global demand for oil combined with a slight increase in domestic demand, prompting additional increases in extraction activity, and extraction of natural gas was largely stable or grew somewhat.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|7|Home demand in the District was essentially unchanged at very low levels, and demand for commercial real estate remained weak, albeit with further modest improvement in some areas. The pace of home sales remained sluggish across the District, putting downward pressure on prices and the pace of new home construction, although sales of existing homes picked up a bit in parts of California. In contrast to homeownership, demand for rental space continued to grow, prompting rent increases and rising construction activity for multifamily units in some areas. Conditions in commercial real estate markets remained challenging, as vacancy rates for office and industrial space stayed high in many parts of the District. However, contacts continued to note improvement in investor demand and leasing activity in a few major markets, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|7|District banking contacts reported that loan demand was little changed on balance compared with the previous reporting period. Businesses' cautious approach to capital spending continued to restrain demand for commercial and industrial loans, although scattered reports pointed to intensifying competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses. Looking ahead, reports from contacts in most sectors suggest that capital spending will expand only modestly through the duration of the year. Consumer loan demand was largely unchanged. Lending standards remained relatively restrictive for most categories of business and consumer loans. Venture capital financing expanded further, with contacts noting heightened levels of IPO activity.
boston|Retail|2011|7|First District retailers report mixed sales results for the early summer months, with comparable same-store sales varying from flat to mid single-digit increases from year-earlier. A few contacts mention the favorable impact of promotional activity on sales and consumers' shopping patterns. Inventory levels are mixed. Several contacts note upward price pressure on commodities including paint, copper, plastics, and cotton, and one says vendors have given notice of price increases to take effect during the coming months; however, another contact notes a lessening of cost pressures. Respondents are passing along price increases where possible. Headcount is mixed, with some firms adding people in line with new store openings and limited hiring opportunities, and a few consolidating headcount. Capital spending is primarily limited to new store or renovation opportunities and select IT projects. Outlooks range from concerned to cautiously optimistic, although the majority of respondents cite apprehension about the government's ability to handle the debt ceiling crisis.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|7|Business conditions at contacted manufacturers generally remained good in the second quarter, but results across individual firms and business segments are more mixed than in recent reports. A firm in the aerospace industry cites strong sales as clients purchased parts to implement previously deferred maintenance. A food products manufacturer and a plastics manufacturer also report relatively strong sales volume for the first half of the year. In contrast, a business services firm sees "soft " demand from small businesses, while another says sales in its banking services business were weak because of continued pressure on banks to cut costs. Growth in government-related sales continues to be sluggish. In addition, a company whose products are heavily dependent on consumers' discretionary spending reports that customer demand in the U.S. is weak this year compared to last, although international demand remains strong. Finally, a manufacturer that supplies energy-efficiency-related products to the commercial real estate sector notes that demand declined in the second quarter relative to the first quarter despite higher energy prices in the more recent quarter; they attribute this unusual sales pattern to economic uncertainty. A number of other manufacturers also note that even though their business remains good overall, at least some segments are being restrained by their customers' uneasiness about the current federal fiscal situation and overall low consumer confidence.
boston|Selected Business Services|2011|7|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District generally report strong growth during the second quarter of 2011. Most respondents cite year-over-year revenue growth in the 10 percent to 20 percent range, although one consulting firm reports flat revenue and another acknowledges a 9 percent revenue decline. Contacts note that advertising and consulting as industries are very procyclical and have thus benefitted from the recent recovery in the corporate sector.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|7|Conditions in New England's commercial real estate market are little changed since the last report. Fundamentals continue to improve across the region, but at a very slow pace. Boston contacts perceive a modest uptick in office leasing activity in recent weeks, yet at the same time note that net absorption of office space slowed in the second quarter compared to the first. Respondents expect Boston's office leasing market to continue the slow improvement pattern of recent months, but say that weak employment reports for the U.S. as a whole constitute a downside risk. In Rhode Island, leasing activity is described as slow, but deals in progress are likely to improve the picture in coming months. Portland's commercial leasing market is said to be stable, but the outlook there looks increasingly uncertain according to one contact.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|7|Throughout the region, residential real estate markets remained stagnant in May, with most New England states posting significant year-over-year declines in home and condo sales. The homebuyers' tax credit, which boosted sales in the first half of 2010, contributed significantly to the year-over-year declines observed in May, but contacts report activity in the housing market remains slow, with the buyer pool resting at weak level. Contacts in some states, however, note increases in home sales compared with two years ago, which they interpret as a positive sign. Meanwhile, median home prices remained roughly steady in May compared to a year earlier, with states experiencing either modest increases or declines; the median price of condos also moved in mixed directions across the region. According to contacts, job insecurity and stricter lending requirements among larger banks continue to restrict the flow of buyers into the residential real estate market. At the same time, inventories continue to rise in the region, although most contacts say current inventory levels are not troubling because inventories in the region have been low, limiting the selection for potential buyers.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|7|Consumer spending posted measured growth. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in June increased over 4 percent compared with a year earlier. Two Minneapolis area malls noted that recent sales were trending above year-ago levels. A representative of an auto dealers association in Montana indicated that sales activity at dealerships during the past few months increased over last year. A Minnesota auto dealer noted that sales and service volumes were up from last year.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|7|Several contacts from across the District reported that recent commercial construction activity was steady at low levels, while construction had stalled in flooded areas. A nutritional supplement producer is building a major addition in Montana. However, construction in the Minnesota transportation sector stalled during the state government shutdown. Some private nonresidential construction was delayed by lack of state government building inspectors. Residential construction increased from last year. The value of residential building permits in June increased 19 percent from the same period a year earlier in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area; in Minneapolis-St. Paul, the value of June permits increased significantly from a year ago.
minneapolis|Services|2011|7|Professional business services firms reported increased activity over the past three months. Results of a mid-July Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey of 55 professional services firms indicated that 47 percent of the respondents saw increased sales, while 29 percent saw decreased sales. Respondents noted that profits and employment also increased. The respondents expected this trend to continue over the next three months. However, a few contacts commented that the Minnesota state government shutdown negatively affected their business.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|7|The manufacturing sector grew modestly. A survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed that manufacturing activity increased in June in Minnesota and South Dakota, while activity declined in North Dakota, due in part to flooding disruptions. Nearly 70 percent of manufacturing respondents to the Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey said their sales increased in the past three months. However, in North Dakota, an electric vehicle plant closed in June to consolidate production in Iowa, and a military equipment plant will close in August.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|7|Activity in the energy and mining sectors was steady. A renewable energy firm recently announced that it will acquire a biodiesel plant in southern Minnesota, which has been idle since 2008, and resume operations there. Wind-energy development projects continued since the last report, including the opening of a 40-megawatt wind farm in Minnesota. However, a utility announced that it was canceling plans for a $38 million wind farm in western South Dakota. Mid-July oil exploration activity decreased slightly from early June. Mining activity continued at a strong pace across the District.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|7|was mixed. While production in western portions of the District was hampered by severe flooding, prices for agricultural outputs remained strong. Preliminary estimates suggest that 6.3 million acres in North Dakota may have gone unplanted due to flooding. Contacts suggested that impacts on hay and feed crops could increase costs for some cattle producers, but a bank director noted that overall hay production in Montana and the Dakotas will be very strong due to moisture conditions. In other parts of the District, crop progress has fared better recently than early-season indicators suggested, but is still behind last year's pace. Prices for some District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including corn, soybeans and dairy products; however, cattle and wheat prices decreased recently.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|7|While private sector hiring grew modestly, the Minnesota government shutdown resulted in 22,000 temporary layoffs of state government employees. In Minnesota, a company recently announced plans to build a data center that is expected to provide more than 100 jobs, and a steel producer will add 60 jobs this year. According to a survey by an employment services firm, 20 percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul expect to increase staffing levels during the third quarter, while 3 percent expect to decrease staff. Businesses in eastern Montana and western North Dakota continued to have difficulty finding workers due to strong oil drilling activity in the region.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|7|Reports from District factories indicate that production was stable or rose slightly during the past six weeks. About half of our respondents noted a rise in new orders. Many of our contacts expect some slowing in the third quarter due to seasonal factors, followed by a modest pick-up later in the year. Almost all steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume declined during the second quarter, which they attributed in part to weakening in the auto sector. Steel representatives anticipate volume remaining close to current levels through the end of the third quarter. Shipments are being driven primarily by heavy equipment and energy-related industries. District auto production showed a moderate rise in June on a month-over-month basis, as supply disruptions caused by events in Japan diminished. Year-over-year production fell, but declines were mainly limited to foreign nameplates.
cleveland|Real Estate|2011|7|New-home construction remains at a low level, with only two of our contacts reporting an uptick in sales during June. Purchases were mainly in the move-up buyer categories. Contractors expect that single-family construction will remain depressed until potential buyers can more easily sell their existing homes and the job market begins to gain some traction. List prices of new homes held steady, while the use of discounting grew. Upward pressure on the cost of building materials was reported by almost all of our contacts. Spec inventories were reduced further relative to year-ago levels. General contractors continue to work with lean crews, and no hiring is expected in the near term. Many subcontractors are struggling to stay in business and are bidding jobs below cost.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|7|Reports from retailers indicate that sales for the period from mid-May through late June rose in the low to mid-single digits. However, for a few chains, the rate of growth was lower than expected. This was attributed mainly to inclement weather. Transactions were mostly higher relative to year-ago levels. Several of our contacts noted that rising sales included some higher-priced discretionary items. One retailer said that her overall sales were up due to elevated gasoline prices. Looking forward, retailers' expectations for the third quarter were mixed. We continue to hear about upward pressure on supplier prices, although it mainly affects food- and fuel-related products. Retailers passed through some of their increases to consumers. Reports on profit margins were mixed, with declines taken primarily by grocers. Capital outlays remain on plan and are slightly higher than year-ago levels. A majority of our contacts reported that they plan to expand the number of their retail outlets. However, no change in payrolls is expected at existing stores.
cleveland|Banking|2011|7|Demand for business loans was generally soft, with activity driven by non profits and energy companies. A few of our contacts noted a pick-up in construction-loan requests for multi-family dwellings. On the consumer side, indirect auto lending was strong, while draw-downs on home equity lines of credit tapered off. Other installment loan categories remain weak. Many of our contacts reported downward pressure on interest rates for business and consumer credit. Applications for residential mortgages declined since our last report, with submissions equally distributed between refinancing and new purchases. Overall core deposits continue to increase, but the rate of growth has declined. We heard a few reports of easing credit standards for commercial and industrial loans, especially for attractive credits. The credit quality of business and consumer applicants was characterized as steady or improving. Most bankers reported a modest improvement in delinquency rates. No significant changes in employment levels were reported. However, about half of our respondents said that they expect selective hiring to occur this year.
cleveland|Energy|2011|7|Reports indicate that oil and natural gas drilling and production showed little change during the past six weeks, with activity in Marcellus and Utica shales continuing to grow. Wellhead prices paid to independent producers have declined. Demand for coal is rising, especially in overseas markets. However, due to transport issues and increasing governmental oversight in permitting and environmental compliance, production remained flat. Little change is anticipated for the remainder of the year. Spot prices for coal, particularly steam, moved slightly higher. Capital outlays are on target, with moderate increases projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming months. The cost of production equipment and materials increased slightly since our last report. A modest rise in payrolls by oil and gas producers was reported.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|7|Freight transport executives told us that shipping volume expanded slightly, as the effects of supply chain disruptions due to events in Japan and severe spring weather in the U.S. dissipate. Expectations call for markets to continue growing at a modest pace in the upcoming months. The price for diesel fuel remains elevated, with most of the increase being passed through to customers via surcharges. Capital outlays are expected to accelerate during 2011. Spending is mainly to replace units that were in service longer than expected. Hiring has been largely for driver replacement. However, we heard a couple of reports that carriers are adding capacity, which remains below pre-recession levels industry-wide. Wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|7|Most District merchants reported that retail sales growth was modest in June through mid-July, although some luxury goods retailers noted steady-to-improving sales. The outlook among most retailers was less optimistic than earlier in the year. The majority of contacts stated that they were keeping inventory levels lean and had no plans to increase supply in the near term. Mid- and high-end restaurant contacts reported improving traffic and sales, although their margins remained under pressure from non-labor input costs. Auto sales from Japanese manufacturers slowed, but dealers noted that the impact of supply disruptions from Japan is ending.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|7|According to reports from District brokers, home sales were slightly ahead of last year's weak levels. Gains continued to be driven largely by reports from Florida brokers. Outside Florida, the majority of contacts reported sales declined. Brokers continued to report declining home inventory levels as fewer homes enter the market and that home prices were flat to slightly down compared with a year earlier. The outlook among Florida brokers was somewhat positive, but elsewhere sales are expected to remain weak.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|7|Manufacturing contacts indicated that production and new orders increased, but at a slower pace than reported earlier in the year. Producers of healthcare equipment and electrical components in particular noted stronger orders, and a producer of freight trucks is significantly increasing output. Many manufacturers reported increased investment in technology equipment in efforts to increase efficiency. While some contacts noted that the acceleration in input prices had begun to moderate, the price of metals remained elevated. Many contacts reported that supply chain disruptions from the disaster in Japan were beginning to moderate.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|7|Banking contacts reported that credit was available, but finding qualified borrowers continued to be difficult. Several cited increased competition for qualified loans. New residential real estate loans were limited, but banks were actively competing for refinances. Business contacts reported credit markets improved, but loan standards remained high. Credit availability for entrepreneurs and real estate developers remained tight, although loans were available for some commercial projects--namely hospitals and multi-family buildings.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|7|Most business contacts indicated that their hiring plans remained modest. Uncertainty regarding future demand and the regulatory environment were the most commonly cited reasons for the muted hiring outlook. Of those that reported plans to increase employment, many pointed to having reached maximum productivity with existing staff. Staffing agency contacts continued to experience high demand for temporary or contract workers. According to reports, demand for qualified, higher skilled candidates is robust, especially in the technology sector. Most contacts said that they did not experience significant upward wage pressure, and characterized annual increases and bonuses as modest.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|7|Some energy contacts have noticed a considerable uptick in early stage fabrication of oil and gas extraction capital goods. Shipbuilding for shallow water supply boats has also increased. Shale exploration has increased as firms employed directional drilling techniques for oil and gas liquids.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|7|Non-auto retail sales continued to run on or above plan in June, with same-store sales running 1 to 5 percent ahead of a year earlier, though reports for early July were more mixed. A number of contacts note that sales of apparel have been performing relatively well, while sales of home goods have been on the sluggish side; one contact notes that fashion apparel has been selling considerably better than more basic items. One large chain reports somewhat stronger sales in its New York City stores than elsewhere in the region; part of this is attributed to tourism. Moreover, one large retail mall in western New York State notes that a continued brisk flow of Canadian shoppers has been a major factor in driving sales. Retail inventories are generally reported to be in good shape. Prices appear to be relatively stable overall: one retail chain indicates that it has raised prices moderately on some lines, but another contact notes that there is somewhat more discounting of merchandise than at this time last year. Sharply higher cotton prices are expected to push up clothing prices moderately in the second half of the year.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|7|Residential construction has remained depressed and housing markets across the District have remained sluggish since the last report, although there has been further improvement in the rental market. An authority on New Jersey's housing industry reports that the resale market has remained weak, and that the level of optimism appears to have waned. Prices of existing homes have continued to drift down, largely reflecting a preponderance of "distressed" sales; otherwise, prices across northern New Jersey are generally flat. While the inventory of unsold new homes is fairly lean now, the inventory of available existing homes remains elevated--as high as 16 months of sales if units in foreclosure and other distressed properties are included. Buffalo-area Realtors also report some weakening in market conditions in May and June; while foot traffic has been fairly brisk, few people have made offers. More generally, sales activity across New York State has been steady to weaker. A major New York City appraisal firm reports that both sales and prices of co-ops, condos, and single-family homes remain flat overall--both in Manhattan and in the outer boroughs--with the high end of the market accounting for a larger share of sales than last year.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|7|Reports from business contacts point to some leveling off in the labor market. A major New York City employment agency reports that recruitment activity has been steady but lackluster since Memorial Day. Hiring in the legal industry has continued to improve from very depressed levels, with large firms hiring once again. Financial sector hiring has been spotty. Still, the flow of applicants for office jobs has declined somewhat. More broadly, contacts in both the manufacturing sector and other industries report some tapering off in hiring activity since the last report, though employment levels are still expected to increase moderately over the second half of 2011.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|7|Bankers indicate increased demand for commercial and industrial loans but little or no change in other loan categories. Bankers also reported a moderate decline in the demand for refinancing. Credit standards were reported to be virtually unchanged for all loan categories--the first time in a number of years that respondents did not report net tightening on the commercial and industrial segment. Respondents report decreases in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories, especially residential mortgages; they also indicate a decrease in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers indicate lower delinquency rates on commercial and industrial loans but little or no change in delinquency rates for the other categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|7|Consumer spending picked up some in June and early July. Consumers took advantage of retailers' efforts to clear inventory through early summer promotions. Spending on apparel and accessories increased as did expenditures on household goods like power equipment and lawn and garden items. In contrast, auto sales edged lower in June, as incentives decreased and showroom traffic declined; sales then improved moderately in early July. Small passenger cars and pickup trucks continued to account for most new vehicle sales. Inventories of small passenger cars remained lean due to continued supply disruptions for Japanese vehicles and higher demand for domestically produced small cars. Demand for used vehicles remained strong, and with used car inventories relatively low, prices rose further.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|7|Business spending also edged up from the previous reporting period. Inventory investment decreased, but expenditures for equipment and structures increased. Several manufacturers reported plans to expand capacity, with a number of projects set to break ground in the District this fall. Renovation of retail facilities picked up further. In addition, contacts reported an increase in spending on research and development. Hiring continued at a slow pace, with many manufacturers reiterating the difficulty in finding appropriately skilled workers. On balance, however, labor market conditions weakened, as a number of private and public sector layoffs were reported and unemployment ticked up in the District. Furthermore, a large staffing firm reported a decline in billable hours.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2011|7|Construction activity remained subdued in June and early July. Construction of new single-family homes slowed, while the construction of apartment buildings increased. Residential real estate conditions remained weak. The spring and early summer season saw a slight uptick in new home sales in the District, which, according to contacts, tends to be a leading indicator of the sales volume for the remainder of the year. In addition, although more potential homebuyers are qualifying for mortgages, contacts noted that downward pressure on existing home prices continues to restrict the availability of credit for new single-family construction. In contrast, nonresidential construction edged up with continued strong demand for industrial facilities, particularly from the automotive sector, partially offset by continued weakness in office and retail construction. Commercial real estate conditions also improved, albeit moderately. Vacancy rates edged lower, with net absorption stabilizing in the retail segment and rebounding in the office market.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|7|production continued to expand at a steady pace from the previous reporting period. Automakers indicated that production was recovering from the Japanese supply chain disruptions in the second quarter. Auto inventories remain relatively low, but given recently lower sales, contacts reported that production would likely recover less sharply than previously expected. A contact in the auto supply industry noted that production losses from the Japanese disasters had been smaller than anticipated, but that efforts to work around supply disruptions resulted in increased expenses for labor, logistics, and parts, putting pressure on suppliers' margins. Capacity utilization in the steel industry reached its highest point since 2008; additional capacity is being added, but at a slow rate. In addition, contacts reported that steel service center inventories are tight. Several manufacturers of industrial metals reported increases in orders as well as significant backlogs in June; however, a few also noted slower activity in recent weeks. Despite some softening in demand from Asia and Europe, overall demand for heavy trucks and equipment continued to be strong, driven by fleet replacement and robust activity in the mining sector. In contrast, shipments of household appliances declined.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|7|On balance, credit conditions improved modestly in June and early July. Funding costs and liquidity tightened marginally and volatility increased in a number of financial markets. In addition, contacts expressed concern about the negative consequences that a potential sovereign default would have on financial markets. Credit availability continued to improve, though standards remained tight for many borrowers. Competition among lenders for the highest-quality customers has been stiff, lowering the cost of capital for these borrowers. Business loan demand was steady. Businesses continue to mostly refinance existing debt, though a contact noted that increasingly such deals were also beginning to include an expansionary element. Consumer loan demand improved, with the pace of deleveraging by consumers slowing somewhat. The rate of improvement in both business and consumer loan quality reportedly flattened out.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|7|Cost pressures remained elevated in June and early July. Food prices continued to rise, while prices for energy and some industrial metals, like steel, declined. Despite these recent declines, prices for many commodities remain elevated, and contacts indicated that fuel surcharges and shipping costs have yet to come down. Many wholesale prices also continued to rise, with pass-through of these higher costs to the retail sector picking up from the previous reporting period. Wage pressures, however, remained moderate.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|7|There were mixed changes in crop conditions throughout the District. A small percentage of acres along the Missouri River were lost to flooding. Though there was some concern about recent above-average temperatures, contacts still see the potential for good to excellent corn and soybean yields this fall, contingent upon favorable weather for the rest of the summer. Historically low stocks of corn and soybeans have put a premium on delivery commitments before harvest. On balance over the reporting period, cash prices for corn, wheat, and cattle were down while prices for soybeans, milk and hogs prices moved higher; all of these prices, however, remained above the levels of a year ago. Livestock operations faced margin pressure from high feed costs. Some elevators were under financial pressures due to expanded margin calls on their contracted positions as well as higher costs for planned input purchases for next year's crop.
dallas|Prices|2011|7|Selling prices were flat or higher since the last report. Most manufacturers said selling prices were stable, while several service sector companies were able to enact some price increases, including transportation and retail firms. These price increases were in response to higher input prices. Accounting, legal and staffing firms reported slight increases in rates charged for their services. Input prices increased at most responding firms, although several contacts said upward pressure from higher energy costs eased in recent weeks as oil prices declined. Transportation firms, including airlines, noted that the recent price declines for fuel will have a larger impact on input costs later in July and August. Retailers said cost pressures were squeezing margins, and food manufacturers said commodity prices were up significantly from last year.
dallas|Labor Market|2011|7|Employment levels held steady at most responding firms, although there were several reports of hiring. Staffing firms reported continued strong demand for their services. In addition, there were some mentions of moderate employment increases from automobile dealers, transportation service firms and manufacturers of primary and fabricated metals, transportation equipment, lumber and food. Legal firms noted solid demand for talented attorneys, and added that start dates for some new hires had been moved up from January 2012 to fall 2011. In contrast, one construction-related manufacturer reported a new round of layoffs, and one retail firm was considering reducing staff levels next year. Wage pressures remained minimal, although some contacts noted that they were giving modest pay raises.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|7|Reports from construction-related manufacturers were mixed. Overall, activity levels appeared to be unchanged. Multifamily activity provided a boost to some firms, although several contacts said public and government demand had diminished. In particular though, fabricated metals producers noted a pick-up in growth since the last report due to infrastructure projects. Construction-related outlooks were generally flat to slightly up, and contacts believe there will not be much rebound until residential and commercial construction recover, which may take longer than previously expected.
dallas|Retail Sales|2011|7|Retailers reported a slight increase in activity over the reporting period. Compared to a year ago, same store sales are up in the mid-to-low single digits. Apparel and jewelry are segments that have performed well recently. Concerns remain regarding the elevated level of unemployment. Texas sales increased slightly more than the nation on average, according to one large retailer. The second half of the year should see modest year-over-year growth. Automobile demand remains strong, but supply constraints stemming from Japan are limiting sales. Japanese manufacturers are primarily affected, but inventories of domestic autos are below desired levels as well. This is expected to last for another 90 days or less before improving through year-end.
dallas|Non-financial Services|2011|7|Staffing firms reported continued strong demand for their services. Temp-to-hire activity has been a bright spot, with long assignment lengths and several conversions to permanent hires. Outlooks are cautiously optimistic, with most respondents expecting continued strength in demand through year-end. Accounting firms noted a seasonal slowdown in demand for their services. Legal firms reported mostly steady demand, with continued growth in transactional services.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|7|Financial firms reported relatively flat loan demand. National banks reported less pickup in corporate loan demand following a very active first half of the year, while commercial real estate (CRE) activity has continued its trend of improvement. Regional banks noted that loan demand has been mixed, while loan pricing remains aggressive amidst a highly competitive lending landscape. Outlooks are generally positive in light of better outstanding loan quality and continued gradual improvement in lending conditions. Optimism has been tempered by consumer fear regarding economic and fiscal policy uncertainty as well as the burden and costs associated with the implementation of new regulations.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2011|7|Single-family home sales remain weak, particularly in the lower priced segment of the market. Contacts say demand is choppy from month to month, but most expect some improvement in the second half of the year.
dallas|Energy|2011|7|Domestic drilling activity remained strong since the last report, according to Eleventh District firms in the energy industry. The rig count continues to shift towards oil-directed drilling, and contacts noted horizontal drilling and fracturing activity remain very profitable. In the Gulf of Mexico, 15 rigs have been re-permitted--with seven currently working and near completion--although a lack of new permits this year has led to some concerns about the prospects for Gulf work later in the year. International activity remains strong, but profit margins are thin.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|7|Drought conditions worsened, with about three-quarters of the district now in the most severe drought classification. Most Texas counties were designated natural disaster areas in June because they lost at least 30 percent of crops and pasture to drought. President Obama signed a disaster declaration in July for 45 counties in Texas that were heavily impacted by wildfires, which allows federal aid to help with recovery efforts. Crop conditions continued to deteriorate, causing low yields and complete crop losses in some instances. Farmers will depend heavily on crop insurance payments this year. Ranchers continued to cull herds due to very poor grazing conditions, limited hay supply and costly supplemental feeding.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|7|Manufacturing activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or reduce operations. Firms in the wood, organic dye, automobile parts, lime, and hygiene product manufacturing industries reported plans to expand operations and hire new workers. Furthermore, a major firm in the automobile manufacturing industry announced plans to hire a significant number of new workers. In contrast, firms in the ice cream, air conditioner, and wrapping paper manufacturing industries announced plans to close plants and lay off employees.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|7|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, May 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 15 percent in Louisville, 13 percent in Memphis, and 21 percent in Little Rock and St. Louis. Residential construction also continued to decline throughout the District. May 2011 year-to-date single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 30 percent in Little Rock, 34 percent in St. Louis, 23 percent in Memphis, and 27 percent in Louisville.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|7|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 1.0 percent from late March to late June. Real estate lending, which accounts for 74.3 percent of total loans, decreased 1.4 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.6 percent of total loans, increased 0.8 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of total loans, decreased 6.0 percent. All other loans, roughly 5.4 percent of total loans, increased 13.6 percent. During this period, total deposits at these banks decreased 0.5 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|7|The majority of the corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, and cotton crops in the Eighth District are currently in fair or better condition. Winter wheat harvests are either complete or close to completion in all District states, and the production of winter wheat and the area harvested for the crop increased from 2010 to 2011. Finally, the fraction of pastures in good or better condition has declined in most District states since our previous report. Year-to-date coal production for the District, at the end of June, was 6.1 percent higher than the same period in 2010, and monthly production for June was 1.3 percent higher than production for June 2010.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|7|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers reported a lull in the growth of new orders and a slowdown in the modest growth rate of shipments. However, activity was reported to be a bit stronger in July. Among key manufacturing sectors in the Third District, the number reporting increases of both shipments and orders has narrowed since the last Beige Book. Growing product demand was reported by makers of furniture; instruments; stone, clay, and glass products; and printers and publishers. However, makers of food, apparel, chemicals, rubber, primary metals, fabricated metals, and electronics reported declining product demand. Comments from firms were mixed, with several citing an ongoing lull in customer demand, a few surprised by unseasonal increases, and many concerned by economic uncertainties.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|7|Third District retailers reported stronger sales in June than a year earlier. Shopping trips and a willingness to spend were aided by falling gas prices since the previous Beige Book. Consumers continue to search for value, and retailers continue to respond with merchandise at lower price points. ers remain cautiously optimistic as the critical September through December retail period approaches. However, given the slow growth so far this year, one retailer indicated that it would likely implement only half of this year's capital budget plan.
philadelphia|Finance|2011|7|Third District banks contacted in July indicated little change in loan volumes outstanding. Many sources reported continued weak demand from small businesses; some bankers cited stronger lending to middle market businesses. Revolving credit had bounced back somewhat in June, after a fall-off in April and May; however, the gains may have been lost in early July. On balance, total credit extended by banks in the region has been flat to slightly down. Expectations for better growth were not met for the most recent period--dampening expectations for anything but the slightest improvement in the near future, according to banking contacts.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|7|Residential real estate activity in the Third District has changed little since the previous Beige Book. While some agents reported positive comparisons during June and early July for showings and sales compared to year-ago levels, activity last year was soft after the tax credit expired. Agents and builders continue to report stronger sales among mid- and low-priced homes, but incidences of high-priced home sales are increasing. Reports of multiple offers for condos in center city Philadelphia were noted by one agent as a glimmer of improvement. Most market participants do not expect the year as a whole to be markedly different from last year. In most parts of the Third District, sale prices of existing homes continue to fall slightly; in a few areas, prices were unchanged. Traffic and sales of new homes have weakened since the last Beige Book; however, one builder reported an uptick in activity in Pennsylvania in the last two weeks.
philadelphia|Services|2011|7|Reports from Third District service-sector firms were slightly positive overall, but firms described various challenges. A recurring theme was a recent slowdown in hiring, especially from small and medium-sized businesses. One staffing agency described "almost a stop to new [excludes replacement] hiring orders in the last three weeks." Other firms cited projects delayed due to ongoing economic uncertainties, including government-related projects contingent on budget negotiations. The most positive firms recognized that the "easy year-over-year comps are over" in this recovery and that continued growth will be slow. Despite these challenges, most service-sector firms expect growth to be somewhat better over the next six months.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|7|Since the previous Beige Book, the percent of manufacturers reporting increases in prices paid for inputs dropped from more than one-half to one-third. Over the same period, the percent reporting decreases in prices received for their own products rose from nearly zero to over one-sixth. Rising commodity prices continue to pressure retailers, service-sector firms, and home builders to pass through costs when they can and to lower the price-point of their offerings. There are a few reports of a little upward pressure on rents in selected local markets for apartments and some retail space. Meanwhile, there is little evidence of pressure on wages.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|7|Consumer spending increased overall in most Districts since the last Beige Book. The New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated modest growth of nonauto retail sales, and the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts noted relatively strong growth. Retailers in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts reported mixed results across product lines, while St. Louis District retailers reported slowing sales. Stronger sales in some New York City stores were attributed to tourism, while one large mall in western New York credited Canadian shoppers as the source. A major Philadelphia District retailer suggested that increased shopping trips and a greater willingness to spend were due to lower gas prices since the last Beige Book. Inventory levels were not a strong concern. Contacts from half of the Districts noted upward pressure from supplier prices--cotton was often mentioned--and other non-labor inputs, especially food and energy. Some retailers were able to pass through some cost increases, but for many, especially restaurants, profit margins were squeezed. Restaurant contacts in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts still managed to report strong sales.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|7|Growth of nonfinancial services advanced further during this Beige Book period for the Districts overall. The Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported the strongest advances. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported slight improvements, while activity in the New York District flattened. Respondents remained optimistic about growth over the next three to six months in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. However, the New York District's contacts were less optimistic than they were when polled for the previous Beige Book. High-tech firms in the Kansas City District expressed an optimistic outlook and planned to increase capital spending.
summary|Manufacturing|2011|7|activity expanded overall, with two Districts reporting somewhat stronger growth since the last Beige Book, many Districts reporting steady or slowing in growth, and two Districts reporting little change. Auto production in the Cleveland District rose moderately, as supply disruptions caused by events in Japan diminished. The Kansas City District also reported a rebound in manufacturing activity from a low level in the prior survey period, while activity at high-tech firms expanded further. Foreign demand for metal fabrication and overall demand for semiconductors and other technology products contributed to slightly faster growth rates in the San Francisco District. Manufacturers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported continued growth at a relatively steady pace from the previous reporting period. The Chicago District cited a rebound in auto production and strong demand for heavy trucks and equipment.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|7|Residential real estate sales in almost all Districts were little changed from the last Beige Book. Activity edged up in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Of the Districts reporting on home prices, most said that they were flat or declining. The Boston and Richmond Districts reported steady prices; the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts reported that prices were steady to down slightly; and the Kansas City and New York Districts reported that prices were down. Increasing inventories of unsold homes in the Boston, New York, and Kansas City Districts have restrained building in the single-family housing sector. Residential construction activity overall was mixed, though it increased in the Minneapolis District. Since the previous Beige Book, construction and activity in the residential rental market have continued to improve in the New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.
summary|Banking and Finance|2011|7|Reports of loan demand were more mixed than in the previous Beige Book. The New York, Richmond, and Chicago Districts reported overall increases in loan demand but from different sources. Commercial and industrial loans accounted for the growth in the New York District, while consumer loans accounted for the growth in the Chicago District. Loan growth in the Richmond District was driven by consumer lending, real estate loans for apartments, and commercial loans for larger companies. Total loan volume decreased in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts, reflecting decreases in real estate lending and individual loans in St. Louis and reductions in consumer installment, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans in Kansas City. The Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported relatively little overall change in loan volume, while the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts reported mixed results. Outside of banking, the San Francisco District indicated increased investment activity by venture capital firms and higher levels of IPO activity.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|7|Severe drought conditions adversely affected parts of the Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, causing low crop yields, complete crop losses, wildfires, and loss of grazing land in many areas. The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that ranchers had culled herds or placed cattle on feed lots in response to poor pasture conditions, despite higher feed lot costs that trim their margins. Meanwhile, the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts noted that flooding had caused millions of acres to go unplanted. The Atlanta District reported that rain brought relief to some stressed pastures and crops, but farm labor shortages had impaired Georgia's fruit and vegetable production. The St. Louis District reported fair or better conditions for corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, and cotton crops, plus an increase from 2010 in its winter wheat production. Kansas City reported good or better conditions for corn and soybean crops. Agricultural prices were mixed since the last report, with the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reporting lower cattle and wheat prices, while soybean and dairy prices were up. Chicago also reported higher prices for hogs.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|7|Labor market conditions remained soft in most Federal Reserve Districts. Employment, especially among temporary hiring agencies, improved in the Richmond District in recent weeks. Modest hiring increases, often within specific sectors such as advertising in the Boston District and manufacturing in the Cleveland District, contributed to modest overall employment gains. Small gains were also noted in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. The New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago Districts reported a slowdown in the pace of hiring activity. A staffing firm in the Chicago District reported a decline in billable hours.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|7|District manufacturing stalled in July after exhibiting moderate gains in June. A producer of coated steel reported that orders had declined during the entire second quarter. He noted that typically the second and third quarters were the strongest for his company, but that he was not seeing any improvement in either June or July. Similarly, a furniture manufacturer indicated that business had slowed in recent months, particularly for furniture collections for the home. Several firms reported that working capital constraints, coupled with the inability to pass through raw material increases, had limited their ability to expand their business. In addition, a few contacts mentioned that automotive deliveries had slowed and material costs had increased recently as a result of the production interruptions in Japan. Our latest manufacturing survey indicated that prices of both raw materials and finished goods grew more slowly over the last month.
richmond|Retail|2011|7|ers across the District generally reported mixed sales since our last report. A few retailers, for example, reported that mid-price items languished in recent months, and customers bargained hard for discounts. Several clothiers told us that their apparel sales fell--except in higher-end goods. In addition, rising cotton and wool prices were pushing clothing prices higher. Our recent survey of retailers indicated some weakening in revenues, although the weakness was not as pronounced as a month earlier. However, several discount stores reported increased shopper traffic and an uptick in total sales. Grocery store contacts also reported rising sales, as did some wholesale building supply firms in the D.C. area. Several luxury retailers reported solid sales, and an auto dealer indicated strong sales in recent weeks. One West Virginia dealer noted that foreign makes continued to "outsell production."
richmond|Services|2011|7|Service sector activity was flat to slightly stronger in recent weeks. Revenues strengthened moderately, according to polled contacts, particularly in telecommunications. A number of builders and construction-related firms in the D.C. area also reported a pickup in business during the past month. Most contacts we surveyed at restaurants and hotels said revenues accelerated since the start of summer. However, advertising agencies indicated that business was flat, and healthcare services providers reported little change. Non-retail services providers' prices rose at a slightly quicker pace over the last month, according to our recent survey.
richmond|Finance|2011|7|Loan demand in the District continued to improve, albeit at an uneven pace, since our last report. Consumer lending increased in most banking markets, according to contacts, with several bankers citing examples of making loans for appliance replacements and home renovations. A loan officer in West Virginia noted increased loans for auto dealership inventory. And, a banker in North Carolina noted continued strength in industrial loans for warehouse buildings and machinery. However, another banker characterized industrial loans as going more toward high-tech capital goods than traditional machinery. Except for apartment buildings, commercial real estate loans declined in most areas around the District, with several commercial developers reporting continued difficulty getting financing. One banker, however, cited a pickup in commercial loan demand primarily from larger companies, while demand for small business loans in general edged downward. Most bankers stated that intense competition for quality loans was squeezing margins. Several contacts reported that credit quality was flat or slightly improved over the last few months, with the number of late payments edging down. A banker in Richmond said that small businesses, especially retailers, accounted for most cases of delinquencies.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|7|Real estate activity edged higher since our last report. Several Realtors indicated that sales had picked up gradually and that their markets were more active than a year ago. While most of the gains were in the low-to-mid price range, activity also inched up for higher-priced homes in some areas. An agent in the D.C. area, for example, reported that properties in the mid-to-upper price range sold quickly, with the best sellers in the $800 thousand to $1.25 million price range. He added that relatively low inventory should keep market activity fairly strong in that area. A Realtor in the western part of North Carolina said that he was "cautiously optimistic," but added that high unemployment in that area remained a serious drag on sales activity. Realtors throughout the District noted an increase in foot traffic, but sale price movements varied. Real estate agents in the Greensboro, N.C. and Greenville, S.C. areas stated that prices held steady, while a contact in the D.C. area cited a slight increase in sales prices.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|7|Fifth District labor market activity, especially among temporary employment agencies, improved slightly in recent weeks. Most contacts at temp agencies characterized demand as at least somewhat better in recent weeks, although a few agents cited weakness in demand for workers. However, virtually all agents indicated that demand was still stronger than a year ago. Several employment agents cited uncertainty about the economy as the primary factor behind hiring temporary help rather than full-time employees. For example, a Hagerstown agent said that many of his clients were still very uncertain about their future orders. As a result, they were using contingent labor more than they might if they felt that business volume would continue to increase. Increased demand for temporary workers was reported for a diverse set of skills, including light manufacturing assemblers, machine operators, forklift operators and quality inspectors. Respondents to our latest manufacturing survey indicated that employment demand, while fairly robust in June, was little changed in July. Retail hiring rose slightly, according to our recent survey, and hiring was little changed at non-retail services providers. A slight majority of both retail and non-retail respondents indicated that they were increasing wages.
richmond|Tourism|2011|7|District tourism gained momentum in recent weeks. Contacts along the Mid-Atlantic coast reported bookings in line with a year ago--notwithstanding last year's "bump" from vacationers who relocated their vacations to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast during the oil spill disruptions. Hoteliers in several locations noted a trend toward last-minute bookings, although a contact on the coast of North Carolina cited last year's relocation crunch as the impetus for more advance bookings in her region this season. A resort manager in the mountains of western Virginia said that new summer attractions helped drive 95 to 100 percent occupancy at his site. July has been "fantastic," according to a hotel representative in Baltimore, with occupancy pushed up by several big events and by an increase in the number of family reunions. Contacts reported mostly small rate increases for the summer. Most hotel and resort owners expressed optimism about potential business during the 2011 winter holiday season; some were already receiving inquiries.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|7|Consumer spending increased at a solid pace in June and early July, and most contacts expected sales gains in the months ahead. Auto dealers reported strong sales despite reduced incentives, with demand strongest for small, fuel-efficient vehicles. Dealers noted the continued benefit of low interest rates on sales and attributed some of the recent sales boost to tornado damage in areas of Oklahoma and Missouri. Car and light truck inventory levels were reported as generally satisfactory, although shortages remained for some Japanese nameplates due to the tsunami. Restaurant sales accelerated in June, and the outlook for the coming three months remained strong. However, restaurant profit margins were pressured by increased food costs and a further decline in the average check amount. General retailers in the District reported flat sales in the survey period, but activity remained well above year-ago levels. Current retail inventories were viewed as adequate, but many retailers planned to expand inventory in the coming months. Sales of low price consumer goods were strong, while sales of many luxury items remained sluggish. District tourism visitor counts were generally up, especially at Colorado mountain resorts, but were slowed by wildfires and drought in northern New Mexico. District hoteliers reported increased occupancy and daily room rates.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|7|Tenth District manufacturing activity rebounded from weakness in the prior survey period, while high-tech and transportation activity expanded further. Factory operators reported that both production and shipments bounced back following weakness in May. The outlook among manufacturers remained positive as new orders and backlogs similarly rebounded. Inventories of finished goods were stable. Factory employment increased in June for the eighth consecutive month and the average workweek expanded slightly. Raw materials costs increased and put upward pressure on finished goods prices. Factory operators also indicated slightly weaker capital spending plans in the coming six months. Transportation services firms reported increased activity in the current survey period and were optimistic about future bookings. Several trucking contacts cited continued difficulty attracting qualified over-the-road drivers. Sales growth was strong at high-tech firms despite some downward price pressure. High-tech firms remained optimistic about future sales gains and planned to increase capital spending in coming months.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|7|Excess inventory weighed on single-family home prices, while commercial real estate remained weak but stable. Real estate firms reported flat existing home sales, higher home inventory, and lower home prices in June and early July. Contacts reported an increased share of existing home purchases by investors in all-cash transactions. Expectations for improvement in the housing sector were subdued. Home builders reported little new construction activity but noted increased buyer traffic. Entry-level homes sold well, along with high-end homes in some Colorado mountain resort communities. Apartment managers reported higher rents and lower vacancy rates. In commercial leasing, absorption and vacancy rates were flat, and only small declines in rent and prices were reported. Further declines in rent and prices were expected and overall commercial leasing terms continued to favor tenants. Commercial construction remained stable but weak, with strength reported in multi-family residential projects. Builders indicated that access to credit improved slightly. Construction supply firms reported increased sales since the last survey, though inventories increased. Construction materials prices remained steady excluding petroleum-based products.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|7|In the recent survey period, bankers reported weaker loan demand but increased deposits and improvements in loan quality. Overall loan demand was slightly weaker than in the previous survey. Demand for residential real estate loans was unchanged, while demand for commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer installment loans decreased. Credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories, and deposits increased for the fourth straight survey. Bankers reported improvements in loan quality compared with a year ago and in the outlook for loan quality over the next six months.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|7|District energy activity expanded at a solid pace since the last survey, and contacts expected continued growth in coming months. Drilling activity expanded in most District states, however extended permitting delays were noted on Bureau of Land Management sites in Wyoming. Oil and gas contacts expected little change in crude oil and natural gas prices in the coming three months.  firms increased hiring in the current survey period but reported difficulty finding qualified workers. Availability of equipment remained a constraint to expansion, but financing was viewed as adequate. Weak coal production in the Powder River Basin kept output well below year-ago levels. Ethanol production edged up with slightly higher prices and profits this summer.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|7|Agricultural conditions varied with weather and input costs. Poor pasture conditions due to drought in the Southern Plains prompted increased placements of cattle in feedlots. However, initial reports on wheat yields in drought areas of Kansas and Oklahoma were poor but better than expected. The corn and soybean crops were progressing normally and generally rated in good or better condition, especially in Nebraska. Agricultural commodity prices remained high but volatile in recent weeks, shifting with export and production forecasts. Rising feed costs trimmed margins for livestock producers. Higher prices for fertilizer, fuel, and feed boosted farm loan demand. Elevated crop prices fueled further gains in District cropland values.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|7|District contacts reported only limited wage pressures but noted additional upward pressure on input prices. Labor shortages and wage pressures were reported in the retail sector and for select occupations in the high-tech, energy, and transportation sectors. In addition, several contacts expected future non-wage employment costs to rise as a result of increased state unemployment insurance premiums. Manufacturers reported continued upward pressure on input costs; slightly fewer manufacturers reported increased finished product prices. Builders reported higher overall prices for construction materials, and transportation contacts remained concerned about the impact of high fuel costs on profit margins. Expectations across most industries were for further input price increases in the coming three months. Restaurants had raised menu prices since the last survey and expected further increases in the coming months.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|2|Upward price pressures remained very limited during the reporting period. While price increases were reported for some commodities, including oil and assorted construction materials such as cement and wallboard, declines were noted for others, such as natural gas. Price increases for most goods and services continued to be restrained by weak final demand and stiff competition among businesses.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|2|Retail sales continued to expand. Modest improvements in sales were reported for general merchandise such as apparel and smaller household items, with stronger gains noted for traditional department stores than for discount chains. Demand also improved modestly for retailers of major appliances and furniture, but it remained lackluster for electronics. Sales held relatively stable for grocers, although upscale chains saw gains. For retailers of pet products, demand continued to show robust growth.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|2|activity in the District was mixed but appeared to expand further during the reporting period of January through mid-February. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products reported moderate sales gains; reports of ongoing investments in information technology equipment by firms in most sectors suggest that demand growth is likely to continue for these manufacturers. For makers of commercial aircraft and parts, strong demand for narrow-body aircraft along with an extensive order backlog kept production rates near capacity. Activity was essentially flat for metal fabricators, and slack demand combined with a diminishing backlog have raised concerns that production activity may decline going forward. Capacity utilization rates for petroleum refiners held largely stable as robust global demand for distillate products, especially from Latin America, continued to offset weak domestic demand for gasoline. Output and sales of wood products remained extremely weak.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|2|Demand continued to improve for agricultural products and mined metals, but it was mixed for natural resources used for energy production. Orders and final sales grew further for most crops and livestock products, with little or no change indicated for the cost and availability of inputs. Mining activity in parts of the District expanded further for a variety of precious metals and metallic elements used for specialized industrial purposes. Strong foreign demand for oil prompted additional increases in extraction activity. By contrast, warm weather held down demand for natural gas relative to seasonal norms, causing further declines in recent and planned extraction activity.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|2|Home demand in the District persisted at very low levels, and conditions were little changed for commercial real estate. The sales pace for new and existing homes remained quite subdued, although scattered reports suggested modest improvement. Inventories of available homes stayed quite high, putting continued downward pressure on prices and construction activity. By contrast, demand for rental space remained robust, prompting further increases in construction of multifamily units. Conditions in commercial real estate markets were largely unchanged, and vacancy rates for office and industrial space stayed high in most parts of the District. However, additional declines in vacancy rates were noted for selected geographic areas such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Contacts also noted recent improvement in financing availability and investor activity for well-leased office buildings.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|2|Reports from District banking and business contacts indicated that loan demand improved a bit overall compared with the prior reporting period. The volume of new commercial and industrial loans edged up. The reports suggested that businesses generally remained very cautious in regard to capital spending decisions, but many continued to invest in information technology equipment aimed at enhancing productivity. Moreover, many businesses expect to modestly increase their capital spending in the first half of the year compared with the second half of last year, suggesting that growth in business loan demand may continue. The reports also noted continued stiff competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses, placing further downward pressure on loan rates and fees. Strong recent financial performance by technology companies backed by venture capital reportedly has spurred further investments of late. On the consumer side, the reports suggested little change in loan demand. Contacts reported slight improvement in overall credit availability, although lending standards remained relatively restrictive for many types of business and consumer loans.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2012|2|First District retailers responding in this round report that business conditions in early 2012 have continued the improvement seen in the fourth quarter. Contacts ending their fiscal year in late December or early January say that fiscal 2011 sales ranged from down 2 percent to up 5 percent compared to 2010. These results are generally better than they expected at the start of 2011 and reflect strong same-store sales in the last few months of 2011 as compared to earlier in the year; indeed, December 2011 same-store sales ranged from high single-digit increases year-over-year to mid-teen increases. The range of results was wider in January 2012: One retailer reports same-store sales were down 8 percent to 9 percent year-over-year, which he attributes to mild weather depressing demand for winter hardware items as compared to a particularly snowy January 2011. Another saw January comparable-store sales up 7 percent compared to a year ago, and a third respondent enjoyed a 17 percent jump, which he credits in part to the mild winter not keeping customers at home. All contacts note that store traffic is up.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|2|Manufacturing conditions in the First District appear to have improved since the end of last year. All respondents in this cycle report sales growth in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Although many contacts express serious concerns about the situation in Europe, only two say that sales to Europe were actually down. In contrast to the last two rounds, this time few contacts mention weakness in Asia. Contacts among defense suppliers express concern about the budget. One had concluded that programs his firm worked on were largely insulated from cuts but said they are "having trouble convincing our investors of that." Another said that budget issues are leading to delays but not to reductions in sales.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2012|2|First District software and information technology services contacts report that the upward trends of early 2011 continued through Q4 2011 and into Q1 2012. Year-over-year revenue increases in the fourth quarter, ranging from 10 percent to over 25 percent, were generally on par with those seen in the third quarter. Contacts report upticks in demand across a number of sectors and geographies, with a few noting that activity in Europe exceeds their expectations. Growing workloads have led most contacts to continue to add to their headcounts. Indeed, one contact is on track to expand its workforce by over 20 percent in 2012; another, by contrast, reports a modest decrease, with a number of management positions being eliminated in an ongoing realignment. Two contacts say they have increased capital and technology spending relative to a year ago in order to build office space in Massachusetts. Prices are holding steady, with contacts reporting little to no downward pressure. The outlook among software and IT contacts is not appreciably different from that of three months ago; most are cautiously optimistic and expect revenue growth in 2012 to be in the range of 10 percent to 20 percent.
boston|Staffing Services|2012|2|New England staffing firms generally experienced a better-than-usual holiday season in 2011, with business picking up steam in early 2012. However, year-over-year revenue changes in the fourth quarter varied widely, from flat to up more than 25 percent. Labor demand is higher than three months ago, although a few contacts report signs of slowing in the light industrial sector. The growth in demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring has accelerated in recent months, with one contact noting that "clients are definitely ready to hire permanent employees." Notwithstanding stronger demand, the hiring cycle remains elongated, and high-end skill sets are still difficult to find. Bill rates and pay rates have gone largely unchanged since November but remain above their year-earlier levels. Looking forward, New England staffing contacts are generally more upbeat than they were three and six months ago, with many expecting their rate of growth to pick up through the end of 2012.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|2|Commercial real estate contacts around New England describe leasing fundamentals as largely unchanged since the last report, although some note modest positive developments. One Boston contact reports that some tenants are increasingly willing to pay top dollar for prime office space in Boston's Back Bay, but cautions that such instances do not necessarily reflect a broad-based increase in office demand in greater Boston. Another Boston contact describes the city's office leasing market as mostly flat, but grants that rents may have increased marginally in recent months. A Providence contact is more upbeat, noting a healthy increase in deal volume and significant office absorption since the last report. By contrast, office leasing volume slowed somewhat in both Portland and Hartford relative to December. For retail space, Hartford's vacancy rate held up better than expected despite weak holiday sales at some large chains, while in Portland some long-vacant retail properties have seen a rise in inquiries by potential tenants. Greater Hartford's industrial market also saw a modest uptick in tenant inquiries in recent weeks, including signs of life in the area's moribund warehousing and distribution sector.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|2|Sales of single-family homes and condominiums increased in New England in January, with most reports indicating low to moderate growth in sales compared to a year ago. Contacts say recent sales growth reflects market activity more accurately than in previous reports, when year-over-year increases were distorted by the expiration of the tax credit in mid-2010. Meanwhile, the median sale price of homes in First District markets declined compared to a year ago, which contacts attribute to distressed property sales. Concerns surrounding the impact of labor market conditions on housing demand have abated slightly. Respondents note foreclosures and delinquencies continue to affect the housing market significantly, but say these factors play less of a role in New England than in other parts of the country. Contacts expect low mortgage rates and improving employment outlooks to help fuel buyer activity. In the Greater Boston area, rent pressures coupled with low interest rates may push more buyers into the home and condo market.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|2|Consumer spending was solid. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased about 4 percent in January compared with a year ago. A Minneapolis area mall manager reported relatively strong traffic during January. A Minnesota-based restaurant and bar chain reported that same-store sales were off to a good start in January and February. A fast food chain recently announced plans to add more restaurants in Minnesota. A representative of an auto dealers association in Montana noted that recent vehicle sales were higher than a year ago and that availability of new and used cars has improved. Repair shops in eastern Montana were very busy repairing oil-drilling-related vehicles. However, due to the surprisingly mild winter, many District auto repair shops reported a decrease in business because of fewer snow- and ice-related accidents.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|2|The unusually warm weather aided construction activity. The value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was up in January from January 2011. A major Minnesota-based commercial real estate company expects more construction of retail and warehouse structures. Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential building permits increased significantly in the Sioux Falls area in January. The number of single-family building permits increased in Minnesota and North Dakota in December 2011, compared with December 2010. Multifamily construction in the Minneapolis area is in a "boom," according to a major real estate firm.
minneapolis|Services|2012|2|Activity at professional business services firms increased at a solid pace since the last report. Of the 33 firms that responded to a mid-February ad hoc survey, 63 percent saw revenues increase over the past three months, while only 16 percent experienced revenue drops. Over the next three months, 59 percent expect increased revenues and only 6 percent expect sales to drop. A human resources consulting firm noted increased activity with "more proposals and opportunities." An architectural firm noted increased activity and demand, but said the competition remains "fierce."
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|2|District manufacturing expanded at a firm pace. A January survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas. An electrical equipment producer is opening a new facility in Minnesota. An aerospace firm announced plans to locate a plant in Montana. A producer of automotive cooling systems is expanding operations in South Dakota.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2012|2|Activity in the energy and mining sectors continued at strong levels. District oil and gas exploration increased since the last report. In Montana, construction began on what will be the state's largest wind energy development. In addition, regulators in Montana approved an $86 million wind energy project. Iron mines in northern Minnesota were operating at near capacity. A Canadian mining company discovered large iron and titanium deposits near Duluth, Minn., but any mining operations are several years away.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|2|remained strong. January prices received by farmers for corn and cattle increased. Prices declined somewhat for wheat, soybeans, hogs, dairy products, eggs and poultry, but all prices were above their January 2011 levels. According to preliminary results from the Minneapolis Fed's fourth-quarter (January) survey of agricultural credit conditions, 67 percent of District lenders reported that farm incomes increased in the previous three months; 10 percent reported decreases. However, drought conditions spread in Minnesota, the Dakotas and District portions of Wisconsin. Low snowfall combined with erratic temperatures were having an uncertain effect on the District's winter wheat crop.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|2|Some more firms announced plans to expand hiring. An airplane manufacturer announced plans for a new facility in northwestern Wisconsin that will initially create 300 jobs. A marketing company plans to expand its operations in Minnesota and eventually hire 200 more workers. Also in Minnesota, a clothing supplier will add 150 employees at a new facility, and a boat manufacturer expects to rehire former employees laid off during the recession.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|2|New orders and production at District factories were generally stable or moderately higher during the past six weeks. A few manufacturers told us that growth was being tempered by lessening demand from European customers. The majority of our contacts saw a moderate improvement in output compared to year-ago levels. Manufacturers are cautious in their outlook and anticipate modest gains in demand. Most steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume was trending slightly higher. Demand is being driven by the oil and gas, transportation, and industrial equipment industries. Steel representatives are cautiously optimistic about shipments during the second quarter of 2012, and they expect the positive growth trend to continue. District auto production showed a substantial rise during January on a month-over-month and year-over-year basis. Increases were attributed, in part, to the abatement of supply chain issues.
cleveland|Construction|2012|2|The uptick we saw in single-family home construction toward the end of last year has abated somewhat. Nonetheless, builders reported that January sales were above year-ago levels and traffic and inquiries have picked up. Sales contracts were mainly in the move-up price-point categories. Builders' outlook for single-family construction can best be described as uncertain. In contrast, activity in multi-family construction and the conversion of existing properties to rental units is expected to be strong. One of our contacts noted a significant upturn in remodeling and maintenance. Little movement was seen in the list prices or discounting of new homes. A few builders commented that they would like to increase their spec inventory, but they are unable to obtain financing. Employment and wages were stable.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|2|Reports on January retail sales were mixed. According to several of our contacts, the warm winter weather is negatively impacting purchases of seasonal merchandise. However, products used outdoors, such as sporting goods, are selling better than expected. Sales for the first quarter of 2012 are generally expected to improve over prior-year levels, mainly in the low- to mid-single digits. Looking at vendor pricing, reports were also mixed. Retailers told us that lower costs attributable to declining cotton prices were offset by a rise in overseas labor costs. Retailers are satisfied with their inventories except for cold-weather apparel, which is higher than desired. Capital budgets for 2012 will be slightly greater than in 2011 for a majority of our contacts. Outlays will be used mainly for technology enhancements, remodeling, and new store construction. Payrolls at existing stores were stable.
cleveland|Banking|2012|2|Demand for business credit was described as either stable or slightly higher. Any drop-off was attributed to seasonal factors. Requests are being driven by commercial real estate, including spec building, and healthcare. On the consumer side, most of our contacts said that installment loan activity is flat, although auto lending (direct and indirect) continued to show strength. A few bankers reported a decline in the use of credit cards or home equity lines of credit during January. Some stabilization in interest rates for business and consumer credit was observed. In the residential mortgage market, real estate appraisals remain on the conservative side, and a majority of applicants are looking to refinance. No changes were made to loan application standards. Delinquencies were steady or declined across loan categories. Overall core deposits grew, with continued runoff from CDs into more liquid assets. Payrolls were stable, and little hiring is expected in the near term.
cleveland|Energy|2012|2|Conventional oil and natural gas drilling and production were generally flat since our last report, with little change expected in the upcoming weeks. Our contacts attributed these conditions to eroding natural gas prices and the regulatory environment. Well-head prices for oil were mainly steady. We heard two reports of energy companies redeploying drilling resources from dry gas to the wet gas areas of the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has issued 32 Utica shale drilling permits since January 1 and 39 Utica wells are currently being drilled in Ohio. The outlook for coal production during 2012 is similar to 2011 levels. However, output may decline due to lessening demand from electric utility companies and offshore markets. Spot prices for metallurgical and steam coals continued to decline. Almost all of our contacts reported upward pressure on the cost of production equipment and materials.  payrolls are trending higher, especially in shale gas. A few small oil and gas producers are experiencing wage pressures brought on by competition from large firms engaged in shale gas exploration and production.
cleveland|Transportation|2012|2|Freight transport volume has been trending higher during the past few weeks, and for the month of January it was above year-ago levels. Strong demand was seen from automotive, food, and shale gas producers. Our contacts expect volume to grow at a moderate pace during 2012. We continued to hear numerous reports about rising prices for parts, diesel fuel, and other materials. Most of the cost increases were recovered via fuel surcharges and rate adjustments when contracts came due. Capital outlays reached targeted levels for 2011. Almost all of our contacts expect to increase their capital budgets during 2012 over prior year amounts for fleet expansion, replacing aging equipment, and infrastructure improvements. One executive noted that his capital budget for 2012 will be at a pre-recession level. Operators reported hiring for driver replacement or adding capacity, although recruiting qualified drivers is difficult. Some wage pressure exists due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|2|District retail contacts noted that sales and traffic in January and early February were up from a year ago. Final holiday sales reports were generally positive as slightly over half of our retail contacts indicated that sales were better than last year. Roughly half noted that inventory levels were up slightly compared with last month, and most were satisfied with current levels. Most merchants expect overall sales to improve over the next three months. Retailers also expect overall sales to improve modestly over the course of 2012. Auto dealers noted that the warm weather experienced in January likely boosted sales for the month, and they anticipate new vehicle sales to continue to improve.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|2|The majority of District residential brokers reported that home sales accelerated in January and early February and stand above levels from the same time period last year. However, reports from Florida brokers were more mixed. Contacts noted that inventory levels continued to decline on year-over-year basis and home prices were nearly even with a year ago. The outlook among brokers for sales growth continued to improve with most anticipating modest year-over-year gains over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|2|Manufacturers across the region noted more positive results in January and early February compared with previous reports. In particular, firms reported increased levels of new orders along with improved expectations for future orders. Most contacts also signaled that inventory levels have risen in line with these improved order expectations. Three major auto manufacturers announced plans to increase production at their facilities in Alabama and Georgia, and a foreign automaker also noted that a parts manufacturing facility will relocate to the Sixth District.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|2|Liquidity levels remained high at regional banks as most continued to experience high deposit balances and soft loan demand. Several large banks noted some growth in outstanding C&I loans; in part, a result of loan acquisitions from other institutions and continued growth in areas such as energy and healthcare. Bankers also reported increased consumer lending attributed mainly to auto financing. Contacts remain cautious regarding the economic environment and most are forecasting low loan growth in 2012, but do not expect further deterioration in capital levels.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2012|2|Firms indicated that hiring expectations going into 2012 are better than they had been going into 2011. However, many contacts noted that plans to increase profits still revolved around further efficiency gains from improvements in internal operations. Several businesses reported plans to increase payrolls because they expect an improvement in sales going forward. They appeared to have regained their customer base, and these expectations seem to be transmitting into plans for expansion. Some firms still indicated a preference for contract workers for short-term projects, but several expressed increased willingness to consider them for permanent positions. Aside from optimism about future sales, some contacts also reasoned that their current employees do not always possess the necessary skills, leaving firms with no choice but to hire new workers.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|2|Contacts in the energy exploration sector noted that recent lease auctions have helped stimulate more industry optimism, contributing to an improvement in investment conditions. Regional gasoline inventories remained above their seasonal norms for this time of year as national and global gasoline consumption remain relatively soft, although contacts reported ongoing concern about the impact of geopolitical uncertainty in some OPEC countries on energy prices going forward.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|2|Retailers report mixed sales results for January and early February. One retail contact in upstate New York reports strong sales in January, buoyed by continued strong demand from Canadian shoppers. By contrast, another major retail contact indicates some slowdown in sales, with mild weather hampering sales of winter gear in particular. Retailers report that prices continue to be stable overall. Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales activity slowed in January, despite unseasonably mild weather. Sales of new vehicles were down 3-5 percent from a year earlier, though the weakness was not quite as pronounced as the figures suggest because January 2011 was a particularly strong month for comparison. Inventories and product availability have improved and are no longer much of a factor in restraining sales. Rochester-area dealers report continued strength in used car sales, but dealers in the Buffalo area describe such sales as sluggish. Wholesale and retail credit conditions remain favorable.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|2|The home sales market has been mixed but, on balance, slightly softer since the last report, while the residential rental market has continued to firm. Northern New Jersey's home sales market has stabilized but has yet to show any significant signs of a pickup; one industry contact surmises that underlying concern about pending foreclosures and their potential impact on the market continues to weigh on potential buyers. Apartment rental markets in New York City and northern New Jersey have continued to strengthen, with effective rents (factoring in the withdrawal of concessions) up 9-10 percent in Manhattan over the past year. However, New York City's co-op and condo market has softened somewhat thus far in 2012: in Manhattan and Brooklyn, apartment prices have held steady but sales volume has tapered off a bit, while in the other boroughs both home prices and volume have edged down. On a somewhat brighter note, real estate contacts in western New York State report continued gradual improvement in home sales activity.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|2|A major New York City employment agency specializing in office jobs reports little change in labor market conditions thus far in 2012; hiring activity and salaries remain flat. Uncertainty about the economic and regulatory outlook is said to be restraining hiring in the financial sector. An authority on New York City's securities industry indicates that Wall Street compensation remains under downward pressure and that bonuses are down 30 percent or more from last year's levels. Manufacturers across New York State report increasingly widespread improvement in business conditions in early 2012 and report steady growth in new orders, shipments and employment. Non-manufacturing contacts report a modest pickup in business activity and employment since the last report; both were reported to be flat during the final months of 2011. Manufacturers continue to report modest increases in both selling prices and prices paid. Non-manufacturing contacts also indicate modest increases in their selling prices but more widespread hikes in prices paid for inputs.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|2|Small to medium-sized banks report an increase in demand for all loan categories except consumer loans, for which demand was little changed. Bankers report a particularly widespread increase in demand for residential mortgages. Respondents also indicate a continued increase in demand for refinancing. Bankers' responses suggest a tightening of credit standards for commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans but no change for the other loan categories. No banker reports an easing of standards in any category. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories. Bankers also note decreases in average deposit rates. Bankers' responses point to steady delinquency rates on home mortgage loans but decreases in delinquencies for all other loan categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|2|Growth in consumer spending slowed in January and early February. Contacts indicated that activity was boosted by clearance sales and noted an increase in consumers turning to discount retailers. There was also some isolated improvement in the luxury segment, with jewelers and high-end boutiques reporting higher sales. However, the mild winter depressed sales of apparel and other weather-related items, and contacts noted that many retailers were running heavy promotions on unsold winter merchandise to make room for spring inventory. Auto sales were up in January, but down slightly in early February reflecting in part a decline in incentives.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|2|Business spending increased in January and early February. Most retailers indicated their inventories were at comfortable levels. However, a number of auto dealers continued to report lower than desired levels for some models. Several manufacturers also noted that they were tightly managing their input inventory levels to avoid being caught off-guard were commodity prices to decline further or activity slow substantially from the pace of the fourth quarter. Capital spending increased, with reports of capacity expansions in manufacturing and renovations of existing facilities in the retail sector. Labor market conditions improved, although hiring remained selective. A staffing firm reported an increase in growth in billable hours that was largely driven by gains in industrial and office positions. Contacts indicated that many manufacturers were increasingly moving away from contracting with temporary agencies to direct hiring, focusing on higher skilled positions where attracting job candidates has remained difficult. Long-term unemployment remained elevated. Labor market analysts reported that it was becoming increasingly difficult for these workers to find a job, and several contacts indicated that they were hesitant to hire individuals who had been out of work for an extended period of time.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2012|2|Construction activity was up slightly in January and early February. Multi-family construction continued to be an area of strength. In contrast, single-family construction remained weak, and homebuilders indicated that it will likely continue to be until home prices stabilize from their recent declines. Nonresidential construction continued to trend up moderately, although a contact noted a decline in funding for new public infrastructure. Demand for industrial facilities increased, especially in the automotive sector as suppliers are expanding to meet the higher pace of vehicle production. Commercial real estate conditions continued to improve with vacancy rates edging lower from their elevated levels. The demand for office space picked up and rents increased. In contrast, contacts continued to report excess availability of retail space.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|2|After a strong close to 2011, manufacturing production increased further in January and early February. Contacts in the sector remained cautiously optimistic about 2012. Exporters continued to benefit from advantageous terms of trade, and contacts noted an increase in interest by foreign manufacturers in moving production to the U.S. as well as increasing utilization of domestic suppliers. The auto industry continued to be a source of strength. Contacts expected that auto sales in 2012 would hold near the pace seen in January, which, while still below pre-recession levels, would mark another year of recovery for the industry. Demand for heavy equipment also remained strong, led by robust activity in the energy and mining sector. An aging fleet of heavy trucks and machinery and tightening emission standards for such equipment were noted as reasons for the likely continued strength in demand in 2012. Manufacturers of specialty metals also reported solid order books and robust quoting activity. Outside of these industries, however, activity was again weaker. Manufacturers of household goods and building materials continued to experience soft demand, although a few noted a small improvement since the beginning of the year.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|2|Credit conditions were slightly improved from the previous reporting period. Financial market volatility declined and risk premia moved lower across a number of asset classes. Improvements in the availability of credit were noted for both subprime auto lending and commercial real estate, particularly for large apartment buildings. Banking contacts indicated that loan growth continued at a moderate pace with demand from larger businesses being stronger than that from small to mid-sized companies. Even though contacts thought the economic outlook was more positive, they indicated that borrowers and investors remain cautious, citing uncertainty about future tax code changes and risks abroad, in particular those emanating from Europe. That said, concerns about Europe were reported to have become milder in recent weeks.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|2|Cost pressures were largely unchanged in January and early February, but the volatility of commodity prices remained a concern for many contacts. Natural gas prices remained at historic lows, while prices increased for fuel and metals such as copper and brass. Raw materials surcharges declined and lead times shortened with a few exceptions such as carbide and some hydraulic products. Wholesale price changes were mixed by category, but little changed on balance. Most of the cost increases were being passed on to consumers, but retailers reported that, overall, pricing power remained limited. Wage pressures continued to be moderate, with most contacts indicating that wage increases were expected to keep pace with inflation. Contacts continued to report a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, and noted that increased competition among firms had led to some upward pressure on their wages.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|2|Corn, soybean, wheat, hog, and cattle prices rose during January and early February. Input costs for agriculture continued to increase, led by sharply higher rental rates for cropland. The increases in these costs have pressured farmers' margins. In order to offset the risks of price declines or poor harvests, farmers have been willing to spend more on revenue insurance policies. Estimates of corn stocks have come down and are below where they were a year ago. Given current rates of use, the expected supply of corn in stock just before the next harvest is around three weeks, about as tight as last year. Cattle operations are working to build herd sizes, even though bid prices for cattle are very high. Contacts expected farmers to boost their capital expenditures in 2012 compared with 2011.
dallas|Prices|2012|2|Contacts across most industries said prices held steady. The exceptions were some producers of transportation equipment, fabricated metals and food who noted slight increases in selling prices to partially offset higher input costs. Airlines reported higher fares, and shipping firms noted an increase in express package and freight delivery rates.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|2|Employment levels were unchanged at most responding firms but some contacts noted increases. Staffing firms continued to report high levels of demand. Oil services and machinery firms continued hiring at a rapid pace, and slight employment increases came from some auto dealers, airlines, and transportation, food and high-tech manufacturers. Shortages of skilled workers continued to be reported, particularly for the energy industry. Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure for certain positions such as auto mechanics and software engineers was reported. Several firms said annual cost-of-living adjustments took effect at the start of the year.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|2|Overall demand for construction-related materials improved, and several contacts noted that orders were up from year-ago levels. Mild winter weather, robust multifamily construction and booming oil field activity provided a boost to some producers of lumber, stone, clay and glass. Fabricated metals manufacturers noted a pick-up in growth since the last report, in part due to government projects. Producers of primary metals reported a broad-based increase in orders, and one contact said they were adding a new manufacturing plant. Construction-related outlooks were more positive than in the last report, and several contacts expect a slight rebound in activity this year.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|2|Retailers said overall sales growth was tepid during the reporting period, largely due to unseasonably warm weather. However, sales of non-seasonal items like menswear and home furnishings remained strong. Eleventh District sales trended roughly in-line with the nation over the reporting period, according to three large retailers. Inventories were at desired levels. Contacts noted that the retail environment had improved, and expectations are for moderate sales growth this year.
dallas|Services|2012|2|Demand for business services was solid and outlooks were generally more optimistic than in the last report. Staffing firms continued to report high levels of demand, noting more direct hires than temporary placements. Demand for skilled professionals, particularly IT workers was strong, while orders from the banking sector and demand for clerical staff declined. Legal firms reported steady demand, with an uptick in corporate activity and continued strength in intellectual property, energy and real-estate related services. Accounting firms reported strong seasonal demand for tax related services.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|2|Housing demand continued to firm since the last report. Sales of existing homes increased moderately and new home sales were flat to slightly up. Some contacts noted that in January, which is usually a slow month, buyer interest and activity was strong due to favorable weather and record low interest rates. In addition, a fast-declining inventory of homes was reported. Respondents expect the positive trend in sales to continue, and outlooks suggest a modest increase in new home construction in 2012. Apartment leasing activity remained strong since the last report, and responding firms said Texas markets were outperforming the U.S. average. Investor interest in sales and development of multifamily complexes continued to increase. The pace of current multifamily construction was said to be catching up with historical norms.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|2|Financial firms reported a modest uptick in loan demand. National banks reported strength in middle-market and large corporate lending activity, and several regional banks noted energy-related activity was robust. Outlooks were generally more optimistic than at year-end 2011. Contacts said loan pricing remained moderately aggressive, loan quality continued to improve and problem loans were declining. Respondents noted they were willing to make loans, and borrowers' financial positions were reportedly better than last year.
dallas|Energy|2012|2|-related service firms reported very strong demand over the past six weeks, despite a small dip in the rig count due to low natural gas prices. A few gas-directed drilling firms have announced drilling cuts, but respondents expect oil-directed activity to offset the losses. Oil service firms expect strong orders, high investment activity and good overall prospects in 2012.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|2|Recent rainfall eased drought conditions in several areas, particularly in the northeastern parts of the District. The rain helped refill stock tanks and benefitted pasture conditions. Farmers were a little more optimistic about spring planting. Demand for agricultural products remained strong. Contacts said cattle prices climbed to record levels, largely due to tight supplies. High commodity prices have helped agricultural producers' margins, but elevated input costs have erased some of those gains.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2012|2|Contacts reported that retail sales in January and early February were up slightly, on average, over year-earlier levels. Half of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 37 percent saw decreases and 13 percent saw no changes. Roughly 71 percent of the retailers reported that sales levels met their expectations, 17 percent reported that sales were below expectations, and 12 percent reported that sales were above expectations. About 21 percent of the retailers reported that their inventories were too high, while 12 percent reported that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook for March and April was mostly optimistic: 65 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while 13 percent expect sales to decrease and 22 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's sales.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|2|Manufacturing activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or decrease operations. Firms in the furniture, automobile, food, stone product, air conditioning component, and medical device manufacturing industries announced plans to increase existing operations and hire new workers. Additionally, firms in the automobile parts and primary metal manufacturing industries announced plans to open new plants and hire workers. In contrast, firms in the faucet, chemical, paper product, and lawn mower manufacturing industries announced plans to close plants and lay off workers.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|2|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with 2010, total 2011 home sales were down 2 percent in Memphis, 3 percent in St. Louis, 4 percent in Louisville, and 6 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction also continued to decrease throughout the District. Total 2011 single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with 2010. Permits decreased 15 percent in Louisville, 20 percent in Little Rock, and 21 percent in St. Louis. However, permits increased 1 percent in Memphis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|2|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks showed little change in overall lending activity during the fourth quarter of 2011. During this period, credit standards and demand for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans also remained unchanged. Demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans remained unchanged, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to about the same. Credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans ranged from unchanged to somewhat eased, while demand for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately stronger.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|2|Yields for corn, sorghum, hay, soybeans, and cotton were lower in 2011 compared with 2010, while yields for winter wheat, rice, and tobacco showed positive gains. Monthly output of commercial red meat for December 2011 decreased compared with November 2011; the District's total live weight and number of chickens slaughtered also decreased during the same period. The District's coal production for January 2012 was 1 percent lower compared with January 2011. Similarly, as of early February, year-to-date coal production was 4.2 percent lower than the same period in 2011.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|2|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported further increases in new orders and shipments. Gains were widespread among the makers of food products, lumber and wood products, primary metals, instruments, and electronic equipment. A supplier to the broad industrial market stated that demand accelerated over the past several months and that the production capacity of many manufacturing clients was picking up. Contacts also reported that work was returning from overseas and that foundries were reaching capacity. The primary metals sector reported strong demand from the automotive and heavy equipment sectors. Among the makers of instruments and of electrical machinery, some contacts indicated that the level of demand seen recently has been the highest since near the beginning of the recession. Even the housing sector contributed to slight upticks in demand, according to contacts from two firms that produce housing-related products.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|2|Third District retailers reported little drop-off from the holiday shopping season -- maintaining steady year-over-year sales increases. One industry contact reported better than normal sales for January; another reported perceptible, gradual improvement. All contacts conceded that the mild winter weather may have increased activity, although sales of winter clothes and gear have suffered. Price competition remains tough and shoppers are still very budget conscious, according to some contacts. Overall, retail contacts were a bit more optimistic but remain cautious.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|2|Overall, loan volumes were flat to up slightly in the Third District since the previous Beige Book. The issuance of home equity lines and home mortgages, including refinancing, increased the most, although some contacts were unwilling to write 30-year mortgages at the current low rates. Commercial real estate and C&I lending remained flat. Banking contacts reported low demand for some lines and early paydowns in others. Overall, credit quality continued to improve. One financial contact reported that the pace of loans going into delinquency has slowed, although the rate being resolved by foreclosure or workout remained flat.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|2|Residential builders reported strong activity and sales in January and early February. One Pennsylvania builder said it was the strongest January in several years. A New Jersey builder closed deals that had been initiated in November and then dragged through December; the builder also reports a good backlog of sales. The mild winter weather helped with production and may have boosted traffic. Contacts cited a more active resale market as a positive trend but expressed concern over higher gas prices and increased compliance costs in the mortgage market. A residential broker also reported a stronger January than last year. Builders reported hiring some sales staff. The outlook among builders and brokers is modestly more positive. However, a broker cautioned that increased sales activity will first spur the shadow inventory to emerge and add to the active inventory, before the active inventory can begin to shrink.
philadelphia|Services|2012|2|Third District service-sector firms generally have reported further growth since the last Beige Book. A logistics firm reported very strong year-over-year results through the first six weeks of 2012. Despite some expressed concerns, the contact is hopeful that this strong pace is maintained or improves when "freight season" begins in March. Though somewhat skeptical of the sudden surge in confidence and market enthusiasm, one contact quipped, "I won't fight the tide!" Advertising dollars are expected to build through the year with the Olympics and the presidential election. One staffing firm reported a surprising dip in new orders compared with last year and a shift to short-term orders that are not indicative of growth. The majority of service-sector firms anticipate growth will steadily improve in 2012.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|2|Price levels have remained contained since the previous Beige Book. Auto dealers and freight shippers still command favorable pricing power. Price pressures are mixed among manufacturing firms, with some firms unable to pass their higher costs along. Retailers and homebuilders continue to report tight margins. Wages are reported to be flat, and some firms have substituted lower cost temporary contract workers to reduce their overall wage bill. House prices are expected to fall further; however, nonresidential rents are stabilizing and concessions are scarcer.
summary|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|2|Manufacturing has continued to increase across all twelve Federal Reserve Districts since the previous report. Most Districts reported gains in new orders, shipments, or production. Contacts reported increased capital spending in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts; contacts in Philadelphia and Cleveland also anticipate higher capital spending. Manufacturing contacts in San Francisco also continued to invest in information technology equipment. Auto-related manufacturers in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported increased activity and announced plans to expand operations and open new plants. Primary metal manufacturing showed strong growth in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. Fabricated metal manufacturing increased in the Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts but was essentially flat in the San Francisco District. Steel producers reported that shipping volume was trending higher in the Cleveland District and specialty metal contacts reported solid order bookings in the Chicago District. In contrast to the many positive reports, contacts in some Districts reported plans to decrease operations and close plants. Contacts in chemical and paper product manufacturing in the St. Louis District reported plans to close plants and lay off workers, while manufacturers of household goods and building materials reported soft demand on average in the Chicago District. Manufacturing contacts in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts expressed concern about the risks posed by the situation in Europe.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|2|Retail sales in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts were higher than year-earlier sales. The Boston District reported strong same-store sales in the last few months of 2011, but mixed results for same-store sales in January. Retail sales increased in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, but were mixed in the New York and Cleveland Districts and weakened in the Kansas City District. Retail sales growth in the Dallas District was tepid and consumer spending growth slowed in the Chicago District. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts noted that mild winter weather had depressed sales of seasonal items. Mark-downs on winter merchandise to clear inventory were reported in the Boston, Chicago, and Richmond Districts. Aside from unsold seasonal items, inventories were more broadly reported to be at satisfactory levels. All Districts reporting sales expectations for the coming months indicated optimism among contacts that sales will improve.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|2|Residential real estate activity increased modestly in most Districts. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported growth in home sales, while New York noted steady to slightly softer home sales. Philadelphia reported strong residential real estate activity. In contrast, home sales declined in St. Louis and San Francisco noted that home demand persisted at low levels. Contacts' outlooks on home sales growth were mostly optimistic. Contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas expect home sales to rise further. Home prices declined or held steady in many areas. Cleveland and Atlanta reported little movement in house prices, while contacts in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City reported some declines. Single-family residential construction was weak in Chicago and declined in St. Louis; Cleveland noted that the year-end uptick seen in construction has abated somewhat, and Minneapolis noted increased single-family building permits. In contrast, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported increased multifamily construction activity.
summary|Banking and Finance|2012|2|Reports on banking conditions were generally positive across Districts. Lending increased to varying degree in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Lending was little changed in St. Louis and Kansas City, while loan demand was described as weak in Richmond and soft at regional banks in Atlanta. Demand for business credit was flat to slightly higher in Cleveland and increased slightly in Richmond, San Francisco, and at some large banks in Atlanta. Dallas reported strength in middle-market and large corporate lending, and Chicago noted that business loan growth continued at a moderate pace.

Cleveland noted increases in requests for commercial real estate lending, while contacts in Chicago and San Francisco noted improvement in the availability of credit for this sector. Meanwhile Philadelphia and Kansas City reported flat or steady commercial real estate lending. Demand for commercial real estate loans was flat to moderately stronger in St. Louis.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resource Industries|2012|2|Drought conditions and warm temperatures affected agricultural conditions in some Districts. However, recent rainfalls in parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts helped ease the dry conditions. Crop yields for St. Louis were mixed, with only winter wheat, rice, and tobacco showing positive gains for 2011. Tobacco and cotton yields in Richmond were lower than historical averages. San Francisco reported growth in orders and final sales for agriculture products. Farm values and incomes were stronger in Minneapolis and Kansas City, while Richmond saw a slight drop in farmland values.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|2|Of the Districts reporting on hiring, most indicated a slight increase. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported increased hiring in manufacturing, and contacts in Philadelphia and Kansas City anticipate future hiring in the sector. Several businesses in the Atlanta District also reported plans to increase payrolls. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas noted increased hiring among auto dealers. Contacts in Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas were having difficulties finding skilled or specialized workers in a variety of industries. In contrast, Boston manufacturing contacts reported fewer complaints about being unable to find qualified workers. Chicago noted that hiring remains selective and long-term unemployment elevated, while San Francisco noted limited demand for new workers. Staffing firms in Boston noted that the hiring cycle remains "elongated" despite stronger demand. Staffing firms in Dallas also noted high demand, while a major employment agency in New York indicated flat hiring.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|2|District manufacturing activity advanced further in recent weeks. An automotive parts manufacturer reported that sales remained strong, and the recent strength of sales had driven an increase in his capital spending for equipment. A textile producer saw a general pick up across all sections of his business. He added that his supply of raw materials was tight, due to the low levels of his suppliers' inventories at the end of the year. Similarly, an electrical components manufacturer described business as still reeling from the spillover effects of the flooding in Thailand; he stated that his backlog of orders was large because his suppliers were unable to fill his orders. A furniture manufacturer cited improvement in the past few months, noting that his business usually picks up with rising consumer confidence. Moreover, a fabricated metal producer indicated that business was strong, with January orders and shipments increasing by double-digit rates over December levels. According to our recent survey, raw materials prices grew moderately from a month ago, while finished goods prices grew at a slightly quicker rate than a month earlier.
richmond|Retail|2012|2|sales rose and shopper traffic increased in recent weeks. Big-ticket sales were generally flat, however, according to most contacts. Auto dealers in South Carolina and Maryland experienced a slowdown in sales since our last report. In contrast, a car dealer near Washington, D.C. said that his establishment was hiring more sales associates to handle the increase in customer traffic and sales. Store managers at big box department stores across the District indicated that sales were steady or slightly stronger, and remarked that television sales blipped up just before the Super Bowl. However, the warm winter resulted in mark-downs on a large quantity of winter apparel. A central North Carolina store manager reported that spring and summer apparel had arrived, but the lingering stock of winter clothing had left little room on the floor for new merchandise. According to our recent survey, home and garden retailers reported a pick-up in sales, as did department store wholesalers.  prices continued to rise at a moderate pace since our last report.
richmond|Services|2012|2|Revenues grew a bit more slowly overall at services-providing firms over the last month. Contacts at professional, scientific, and technical businesses gave us somewhat mixed reports. However, an executive at a brokerage firm thought that account statements were "looking better." Recruiters in the Carolinas reported increased demand for permanent employees, particularly "technical talent." An executive at a nationwide trucking firm stated that freight demand increased over the last month. Finally, a North Carolina hospital contact reported a major increase in capital spending to meet new healthcare reform requirements. Prices at services firms moved up at a restrained pace.
richmond|Finance|2012|2|Lending to both residential and commercial customers increased marginally across the District over the last six weeks. However, the level of demand for loans was often described as weak, and several bankers were still reporting little change since the end of last year. While most mortgage applications continued to be for refinancing, loan officers around the District reported a slight increase for home purchases. Also, the average size of loans increased. One banker in Richmond stated that investors, taking advantage of low prices and interest rates, were a key source of such mortgage lending in his market. An official for a large bank also stated that his bank remained very cautious about any consumer loan application, especially for purchasing a home. On the commercial side, several bankers extended more merger and acquisition loans. A loan officer for a regional bank said that his bank had increased its lending for new equipment as well as for refinancing. A Virginia banker reported a slight uptick in lending for inventory. However, other bankers stated that loan demand in those categories was flat. While most construction loans other than for multi-family buildings remained limited, several bankers reported an increase in loans for owner-occupied facilities and their furnishings (mostly to medical professionals). Credit standards remained tight, but most bankers reported that their lending targets were increasing this year, even though competition for quality loans was intense.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|2|Residential real estate activity showed modest improvement since our last report. Indeed, some contacts suggested that the sector had moved beyond the bottoming-out phase. For example, lower inventory of both new and existing homes was reported in the D.C. and Richmond areas, with some builders beginning to sell and even build again. A source from North Carolina said that a housing development was successful due to a "rent-to-own" plan. He added that new construction activity was also starting to occur in the Research Triangle area. While most Realtors reported that sales were either flat or up slightly, housing prices generally continued to decline. Several agents attributed the drop in sales prices, in part, to short or distressed sales being used as comparables. They noted, however, that many buyers were avoiding short sales and foreclosed homes due to often a six to eight month delay in closings. Most Realtors cited sales in the low-price range as faring better than sales in the high-price range. An exception, however, was an agent in the D.C. area, who said that home sales over $1,250,000 were outperforming all other price ranges. He added that he was starting to receive multiple offers that were well above listing prices, and he expected this trend to continue through the spring selling season.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|2|Assessments of labor market activity were somewhat more upbeat than in our last report. Several employment agencies stated that demand for temporary workers had increased and those contacts were optimistic about future demand. A Baltimore agent noted that the demand for temp workers had definitely increased, and his company was experiencing a pickup in recruitment demand for skilled and semi-skilled jobs in the manufacturing and distribution sectors. He added that the agency was beginning to see some upward pressure on wages for manufacturing and distribution center skills, as finding qualified workers remained difficult. A representative at a Richmond staffing agency reported that employers were starting to complain that they were not getting enough qualified applicants. He noted that even with growth in postings, matching of openings with qualified people continued to be challenging. According to our latest survey, District manufacturing employment improved over the last month, while wage gains were slightly lower than a month ago. Both retail and non-retail services employment picked up in recent weeks, while the pace of average wages in the service sector overall increased moderately.
richmond|Tourism|2012|2|remained generally strong, with some contacts reporting further strengthening in recent weeks. A contact on the outer banks of North Carolina reported a good start to the year and strong vacation house rentals, with weekend travel up as a result of good weather. Businesses in that region expect a good tourism season ahead, supported by such scheduled events as music festivals, bike races, and marathons. A hotel general manager in the mountains of North Carolina, where weather was also mild this winter, noted an increase in bookings, and he expected modest growth to continue through the summer season. Elsewhere, several ski resorts have been adversely affected by the mild Mid-Atlantic winter, and a resort in western Virginia will cut jobs to reduce costs, according to an executive.
richmond|Agriculture|2012|2|Unseasonably mild temperatures, coupled with below-normal precipitation held back crop yields in some areas of the District. In North Carolina, tobacco and cotton yields reached only 50 percent of historical averages as a result of damage caused by severe weather last summer. In South Carolina, dry weather late in the season significantly reduced what was previously expected to be an outstanding cotton crop. Moreover, results of our recent agricultural credit survey indicated that farmland values were slightly below the previous quarter and year-ago levels. In contrast, ample amounts of rain throughout Virginia, combined with above-normal temperatures, resulted in above-average yields and near-record commodity prices for most grain producers. An analyst in the Commonwealth described 2011 as a solidly profitable year for most grain producers due to increased export demand.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|2|Consumer spending weakened in January and early February but was expected to rebound in the months ahead. District retailers reported a slowdown in sales after the holidays as consumers shopped for bargains. Still, store owners noted sales exceeded expectations by rising above year-ago levels and many remained optimistic that sales would improve in the coming months. Clearance items moved quickly, and appliance sales ticked up while demand for furniture and electronics was weak. Auto dealers reported a post-holiday lull in sales that boosted inventory levels, especially for SUVs and more expensive car models. However, auto dealers expected stronger demand for smaller, fuel efficient cars would spur sales in the coming months. Some dealerships were hiring salespeople and service technicians. Restaurant sales were down from the previous survey but remained higher than year-ago levels and were expected to pick up with warmer weather. Tourism activity slowed after the holidays and below-average snowfall hurt bookings at Colorado ski resorts. District hotel owners, however, reported an uptick in occupancy at slightly higher average room rates and expected business to strengthen further during the next three months.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|2|Manufacturing activity rebounded, and sales at high-tech service firms rose sharply while transportation activity edged down in the survey period. Manufacturing activity expanded at both nondurable and durable goods factories, particularly those producing chemicals, fabricated metals, and aircraft equipment. After falling in late 2011, the volume of new orders and shipments rebounded in January and February and finished goods inventories held steady with increased production. Plant managers expected production, hiring, and capital spending to strengthen during the next six months. The high-tech industry reported a sharp increase in sales, and some contacts were worried about losing future business due to a shortage of specialized labor, particularly software developers. Transportation activity slowed further but was expected to improve in the months ahead. Trucking firms remained concerned about high fuel costs and a lack of qualified drivers.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|2|Residential and commercial real estate activity picked up in January and early February. Existing home inventories declined as lower prices spurred a modest increase in sales, particularly for low- and mid-priced homes. Real estate contacts expected that a seasonal upswing in sales this spring would stabilize home prices in the coming months. Residential mortgage lenders reported an uptick in loans for home purchases and higher average loan amounts while home loan refinancing activity was expected to slow further. Residential lot prices fell further, and new home starts were on par with year-ago levels. Builders planned to ramp up construction in the coming months and sales rose at building supply firms. New commercial construction increased and was expected to rise further with more projects in the pipeline. Commercial real estate prices and rents dipped during the survey period but were expected to firm as vacancy rates improved. After edging up in January and early February, commercial real estate sales were expected to strengthen further during the next few months. Developers reported little change in access to credit.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|2|In the recent survey period, bankers reported generally steady loan demand, slight improvements in loan quality, and a modest increase in deposits. Most respondents reported steady loan demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans. However, loan demand was slightly weaker for consumer installment loans and residential real estate loan demand softened with slower home mortgage refinancing activity. Bankers reported that interest rates on commercial and industrial loans declined further. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and most respondents reported stable or increased deposits. The majority of bankers reported improved loan quality compared with a year ago, and many bankers expected loan quality to improve further during the next six months.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|2|Agricultural growing conditions fluctuated with precipitation levels. After warm, dry weather in January, recent precipitation kept agricultural growing conditions from deteriorating further. The winter wheat crop remained in fair to good condition. Soil moisture levels were low across the District with western Oklahoma and Kansas experiencing severe drought. Ranchers in the southern Plains continued to liquidate herds due to poor pasture conditions and record high cattle prices. In the northern Plains, the lack of harsh winter weather allowed cattle feedlot operators to reduce feed usage and still maintain livestock growth. District contacts expressed concerns about 2012 profit margins due to rising feed, fuel, and fertilizer costs. Still, a rebound in crop prices fueled additional gains to record high farmland values and more bankers expected farmland prices to move higher in the next few months.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|2|activity rebounded in January and early February and District contacts expected additional expansion in coming months. After slowing at the start of the year, District drilling rig activity rebounded with higher crude oil prices.  contacts, however, noted that a lack of equipment and services and qualified labor were constraints on current drilling activity. District contacts expected crude oil and natural gas prices to hold at current levels and anticipated further expansion in oil drilling activity. Bucking national trends, Wyoming's coal production rose above year-ago levels in January and early February. Ethanol profits dropped sharply as ethanol prices declined with the year-end expiration of the federal ethanol subsidy.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|2|Wage pressures remained low during the survey period, and more contacts reported raising finished goods prices in light of higher raw materials costs. More businesses planned to hire workers during the next three months, and contacts in low- and moderate-income communities reported a slight improvement in job opportunities. However, most firms did not plan to raise wages except for specialized positions, particularly in the high-tech and energy fields. After edging up during the past survey period, more retailers expected to raise selling prices over the next three months. Restaurateurs expected further increases in menu prices due to soaring food costs. Hotel operators planned to increase room rates with higher occupancy rates. Manufacturers paid higher prices for raw materials, and more manufacturers planned to pass on higher costs to finished goods prices. Builders and construction supply companies noted rising prices for construction materials, especially drywall and asphalt shingles. Transportation companies paid high fuel prices, and some were raising shipping rates.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|4|Price inflation for final goods and services was modest during the reporting period. Although prices remained elevated for an assortment of raw materials and commodities and rose further for some, such as oil, the pass-through to final prices was quite limited, with the noteworthy exceptions of food and gasoline. For most other retail goods and services, prices continued to be held down by subdued demand and vigorous competition.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|4|Retail sales continued to improve overall. Traditional department stores and discount retail chains alike reported further increases in sales. Similarly, sales revenues rose for grocers; contacts attributed the gains in part to higher food prices in addition to increased sales volumes. Despite some indications of rising appetites for discretionary spending, consumers remained largely focused on necessities and lower-priced options across a wide spectrum of products. Retailers of major appliances and furniture reported that activity remained subdued. Demand for new automobiles strengthened further, propelled partly by manufacturers' rebates and improved availability of credit. Looking forward, some retail contacts expressed concern that elevated gasoline prices will reduce sales of other items.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|4|activity in the District posted further gains during the reporting period of late February into the beginning of April. Makers of commercial aircraft and parts reported modest ongoing growth in new orders, attributed in part to increased demand from airline companies for aircraft with greater fuel efficiency. For manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, demand continued to grow, with high levels of capacity utilization and balanced inventories noted. Sales rose further for metal fabricators, although contacts reported minor production challenges arising from constrained supplies of raw materials. Demand remained especially weak for manufacturers of wood products, with the exception of firms in the pulp and paper segment of the industry, which saw increases in orders and output. Petroleum refiners reported slight gains in gasoline sales volumes compared with twelve months earlier, despite the demand constraints arising from higher prices and poor weather, and capacity utilization rates were up accordingly. Demand continued to grow for food manufacturers.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|4|Production activity and sales were robust for agricultural products and grew further for metals and natural resources used for energy production. Final sales and orders for most agricultural products, including livestock and a wide variety of crops, continued to expand. As a result, contacts noted rising prices and constrained availability for selected inputs, including fertilizer, seeds, and machinery such as tractors. District mining activity expanded, as higher prices for assorted metals have spurred investments in new capacity. Demand for crude oil was slightly above its level from twelve months earlier, while extraction activity for natural gas expanded, increasing supply and causing the price to decline.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|4|Activity in District residential and nonresidential real estate markets remained at very low levels overall, albeit with slight improvement noted in some market segments and areas. The sales pace for new and existing homes was mixed across the District but remained very weak overall, and contacts again noted that the limited availability of nonconforming "jumbo" loans held back sales of higher-priced homes in some areas. In response to sluggish sales, new home construction stayed quite subdued. However, demand for residential rental space grew further in some areas, and reports noted modest increases in the construction of apartment buildings. Demand remained weak overall in commercial real estate markets, as vacancy rates for office and industrial space remained elevated throughout the District. However, further gains in leasing activity were noted for some major markets in the District, particularly in technology-intensive portions of the San Francisco Bay Area.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|4|District banking contacts reported that loan demand was up compared with the prior reporting period. Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose perceptibly, as businesses in a variety of sectors reportedly showed increased interest in expansionary capital spending. Demand for consumer credit also grew slightly. The reports indicated that competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses has intensified, placing downward pressure on rates and fees. Overall, however, lending standards remained somewhat restrictive for most types of consumer and business loans. Venture capital financing activity and investor interest continued to grow, particularly for companies focused on Internet and wireless applications and digital media.
boston|Retail|2011|4|First District retailers report mixed sales results for the period from January through early March, with comparable same-store sales ranging from modest decreases to mid-single-digit increases. Several respondents note the negative impact that inclement weather had on sales. Sales of apparel, accessories, groceries, and home furnishings are strong, as the consumer continues to seek value.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|4|Business is good overall at most responding manufacturers. One firm in the chemical business reports that sales are skyrocketing and its plants are running at full capacity. Technology-related manufacturers also report that sales growth continued to be strong in 2011Q1. Revenue growth varied across different business segments at more diversified manufacturers, with some sectors such as health care-related products and transportation seeing rapid sales growth and others experiencing more moderate increases. By comparison, the climate has softened a bit for a medical-device producer as well as an electronic-systems manufacturer because of uncertainty about the federal budget; both firms have a portion of their sales tied to customers that rely on government contracts and/or grants and that seem unwilling to spend until the budget uncertainty is resolved. In addition, a manufacturer heavily tied to residential construction reports a further deterioration in its business as housing markets remain sluggish. Commodity prices continue to be a concern for a number of contacted manufacturing firms; they especially mention price increases for oil, precious metals, corn, and wheat. Some firms have already raised their selling prices in response to these input price increases and others plan to do so as the need arises. Companies who recently raised their prices comment that the increases were accepted easily by their customers. A food products manufacturer notes that there have been few objections because their customers are facing price increases from numerous suppliers. At some firms, these recent price increases do not fully compensate for their inability to raise prices in prior years. As a result, profits are flat at one firm despite its robust sales growth, and some other firms are looking for ways to cut costs further. A number of companies also note rising transportation costs for their goods due to rising diesel fuel prices. In addition, firms that use electronic components in their production are somewhat concerned about supply-chain disruptions in Japan. Inputs from Japan are expected to be in short supply soon (if they are not already) and the extent to which Japanese disruptions will impact firms' costs and/or production is uncertain. Respondent firms' sales exposure in Japan, however, is relatively limited and the revenue impact of the disaster is expected to be fairly small.
boston|Selected Business Services|2011|4|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District mostly report significant growth in revenue during the first quarter of 2011. Consulting contacts in particular experienced large increases in demand, with year-over-year revenue increases ranging from 12 percent to 40 percent. They believe that clients are setting aside larger portions of their budgets for consulting or advertising services as the impact of the recession wanes. One exception is an advertising company whose revenue was down 25 percent from a very strong first quarter of 2010. Contacts have slightly increased the prices they charge for their services or they plan to do so over the course of the year.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|4|New England's commercial real estate market was roughly flat in recent weeks. In Boston, office leasing activity is stable, but not sufficient to generate significant positive absorption. Asking rents for office space are either flat or up marginally in greater Boston. However, contacts note that some existing tenants are successfully bargaining for rent reductions, bringing their rents down to current market rates from higher levels agreed upon at the market's peak. In Rhode Island, political uncertainty over budget deficits is said to have stalled business plans, resulting in light leasing activity, but pending deals for downtown Providence continue to engender optimism regarding office absorption in the coming months. In Portland, the commercial market was mostly quiet, with the exception of two significant deals for call-center space. A Portland contact perceives continued downward pressure on office rents despite modest positive absorption. Outlooks across the region call for slow but positive office absorption for the remainder of 2011, conditional on ongoing employment growth in line with recent trends.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|4|States throughout the region experienced year-over-year declines in single-family home sales in February with the exception of New Hampshire where sales increased modestly. The median price of homes also slipped slightly in the region except for Rhode Island where the median price rose. Meanwhile, sales and median prices of condominiums were lower than a year ago except in the Greater Boston area where the median condo price edged up. Contacts cite inclement weather as a factor contributing to February sales declines; sellers as well as buyers were discouraged by the weather, with home listings decreasing as well. Contacts also note that sales in the first half of 2010 were boosted by the homebuyer tax credit, making year-over-year comparisons difficult to interpret.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|4|Consumer spending increased. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in February were up almost 2 percent compared with a year earlier. A mall manager in North Dakota reported that recent sales were up slightly from a year ago. A representative of a retailers association expects restaurant growth during 2011 in Sioux Falls, S.D. However, retailers noted that March sales may finish lower than March 2010 sales due to the late Easter holiday.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|4|Commercial construction activity increased slightly. March industrial and office permits increased in value in Sioux Falls, from a year earlier, but other commercial permits decreased; a large hotel is under construction in the city's downtown. Commercial contractors in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area said activity increased recently, particularly for industrial and medical facilities. Residential construction decreased for the most part. The value of March residential permits in Minneapolis-St. Paul fell 52 percent from a year earlier; in Sioux Falls they fell 26 percent. However, an unanticipated increase in multifamily construction was noted, with several multifamily projects under way in Sioux Falls and Minneapolis.
minneapolis|Services|2011|4|Professional business services firms reported mixed demand since the last report. A web development consulting firm noted increased demand for online marketing services. A logistics consulting company noted an increase in demand due to companies adjusting to the disruptions caused by the disaster in Japan. However, a contact from a mortgage servicer noted reduced refinancing activity.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|4|output was up since the last report. An April survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota. A consulting firm recently released a survey of 400 Minnesota manufacturing companies, which indicated that 51 percent expect increased sales in 2011 compared with 2010. A tractor maker is expanding into a Minnesota facility. A circuit board producer plans to expand in South Dakota. However, in North Dakota, an electronic components plant plans to close. Surprisingly, 41 percent of manufacturing respondents to a late March ad hoc survey by the Minneapolis Fed indicated they were somewhat unfavorably impacted by the disaster in Japan. One contact noted that plastic resin shipments from Japan have been delayed.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|4|Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the last report. Late-March oil exploration activity increased from mid-February. Construction of a $140 million geothermal energy project was approved at a Montana mine site. Iron ore mines in northern Minnesota were operating at full capacity, with expectations that 2011 production will be the highest in more than 10 years. Montana mines were operating at near capacity.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|4|District agricultural producers continued to enjoy strong conditions, in spite of wet weather and spring flooding. Prices for most District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including wheat, cattle, hogs, poultry, and dairy products. District farmers are expected to increase plantings of wheat and corn in 2011, while plantings of soybeans are expected to decrease slightly. However, some farmers have delayed plantings due to the wet conditions.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|4|Labor markets continued to show signs of strengthening. In Minnesota, a data storage company recently noted that it might hire as many as 300 workers this year, and a power generation company expects to hire 90 employees. A manager at a South Dakota mall noticed more job openings than usual. According to a survey by an employment services firm, 13 percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul expect to increase staffing levels during the second quarter, while 6 percent expect to decrease staff. Minnesota initial claims for unemployment insurance were down 22 percent compared with a year ago. In contrast, a Minnesota-based medical device company reported plans to cut as many as 2,000 workers companywide, and a Minnesota-based computer manufacturer will lay off 600 to 900 workers companywide.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|4|Reports from District factories indicate that new orders and production were mainly steady or up slightly during the past six weeks. Declines were attributed to seasonal factors. Compared to a year ago, production was generally higher, with some of our contacts experiencing low double-digit increases. Manufacturers have a favorable outlook, and they expect at least modest growth during 2011. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume met or exceeded expectations, with shipments being driven by energy-related, transportation, and heavy equipment industries. They anticipate volume remaining at current levels through at least the first half of this year. District auto production dipped slightly during February on a month-over-month basis. Compared to a year ago, domestic auto makers showed a substantial rise in production, while foreign nameplates posted a modest decline.
cleveland|Real Estate|2011|4|Although new home construction remained overall at a low level, a few general contractors noted a pick up in traffic and sales. Purchases were mainly in the move-up buyer categories. Little change in sales was noted on a year-over-year basis. Home builders expressed somewhat more of an optimistic outlook than during the past several months, which they attributed to seasonal factors and slightly better-than-expected activity during February. List prices and discounting of new homes have held steady since our last report, while some upward pressure on the cost of building materials was reported. Little movement was seen in land positions or spec inventories. A few builders said they want to construct more spec houses, but they are unable to obtain financing. We heard many reports of subcontractors struggling to stay in business, while general contractors continue to work with lean crews. No hiring is expected in the near term.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|4|Reports from retailers indicate that sales for the period from mid-February through mid-March were generally on or ahead of plan, and were mostly higher relative to year-ago levels. Sales of warm-weather apparel and recreational products have picked up. A few of our contacts reported that the low- to mid-market segments still face considerable stress. For the second quarter of 2011, retailers expect transactions to rise on a year-over-year basis, with several anticipating low to mid-single digit gains. We continued to hear about increasing prices from vendors, which were primarily attributed to a rise in the cost of agricultural commodities. Accordingly, some retailers have raised their prices, especially for food products. Profit margins were generally steady or showed a slight improvement. Capital spending is mainly for store remodeling, new store openings, and e-business expansion, with a corresponding increase in payrolls. No change in employment is expected at existing stores.
cleveland|Banking|2011|4|Bankers reported that demand for business loans grew at a modest pace since our last survey. Although demand was characterized as broad-based, some bankers commented that applications were strongest from health-care providers and energy companies. On the consumer side, a majority of our contacts indicated that credit demand has picked up slightly, primarily for vehicle purchases (direct and indirect) and home equity lines of credit. Interest rates for business and consumer credit were stable, but competitive. Demand in the residential mortgage market is mainly for refinancings, although applications have slowed due to rising interest rates. Core deposits continue to grow, but at a lower rate, with almost all growth occurring in nonmaturing products. Credit standards were unchanged. The credit quality of businesses and consumer applicants was characterized as stable or improving, while delinquency rates were steady or trending down across most portfolios. Staffing levels have shown little change during the past few weeks, and only selective hiring is expected during 2011.
cleveland|Energy|2011|4|Reports indicate that oil and gas output from conventional wells was fairly steady during the past six weeks, with little change expected in the near term. Spot prices for natural gas were steady to trending down, while wellhead prices paid to independent oil producers showed a modest increase. Coal production was stable to moderately lower since our last report, with little change anticipated in the near term. Coal prices held steady. We heard widespread reports of increased costs for diesel fuel and other equipment and materials used in coal production.  payrolls are expected to remain at current levels.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|4|Freight transport executives reported that shipping volume rose from early February through mid-March, after a greater-than-expected seasonal decline during January. Two of our contacts noted that they are seeing a slight pickup in shipments of residential construction materials. Looking ahead, carriers expect that markets will continue to recover. The price for diesel fuel remains elevated, with most of the increase being passed through to customers via surcharges. We also heard about rising prices for tires and packaging materials. One executive said that he plans to increase his shipping prices as customer contracts come up for renewal. Capital outlays are expected to rise modestly during 2011 to replace aging equipment. Little capacity expansion is expected. Hiring has been for replacement and seasonal work. Slight wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|4|Most District merchants reported that retail activity improved in February and March following a lackluster January. Retailers reported that they do not plan to make any changes to the tight inventory management practices currently in place. The outlook among District retail contacts remains optimistic; however, rising gasoline prices and its potential impact on consumer confidence and spending was a concern. Automobile dealers described robust sales growth and a strong demand outlook. A few noted that an improvement in consumers' access to credit contributed to the increase in sales.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|4|Reports from District homebuilders on new home sales in February and March were mixed. Florida and Georgia builders stated that sales were below year-ago levels, while elsewhere in the region sales were similar to year earlier levels. Homebuilders noted that construction activity remained below last year's level and inventories eased further. Several residential construction contacts remarked that financing remained very difficult to secure.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|4|District manufacturers noted strong growth in new orders and production. Respondents also signaled stable or higher levels of employment. The majority of manufacturing contacts continued to indicate they will be increasing production in the short-term.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|4|District bankers reported that demand for most types of loans remained low and lending standards remained tight in February and March. Many cited that credit was available but finding qualified borrowers continued to be difficult. Some community bankers noted encouraging reports of loan demand surfacing in the last few months, especially among small business owners.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|4|Labor markets continued to recover gradually across the region. Business contacts indicated that their hiring plans for the year are to leave employment levels unchanged or to increase them slightly. Many firms noted that they have no problem finding workers with the necessary skills. However, there were isolated but increasing reports of difficulty finding qualified candidates to fill specialized, higher skilled positions.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|4|Regional crude oil inventories continued to rise in February and March as the industry builds stocks in anticipation of the summer driving season. Though the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico is still only about half the pre-oil spill level, deep-water drilling permits were issued in late February for the first time since the Gulf oil spill last April. Industry contacts noted that the recent international events, including Japan's nuclear crisis and the unrest in the Middle East, have added additional uncertainty to their outlooks for investment and hiring.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|4|Retailers generally report strong results for February and March. One major retail chain notes that sales were ahead of plan in February and March, while another describes sales as on plan. Two major malls in western New York State also characterize sales as steady and strong, continuing to be buoyed by a flow of Canadian shoppers. A number of retail contacts note that, due to the later Easter this year, sales were modestly lower in March than a year earlier, but this effect is expected to be reversed in April. Unseasonably cool weather was not considered a major factor. Two major retail chains note that New York City under-performed the rest of the region in terms of sales growth last month. Inventories are generally reported to be at desired levels, and prices are reported to be stable, though one large retailer notes that it is testing out price increases on certain lines of merchandise.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|4|Housing markets across the District have been generally stable since the last report, with the lower end of the market generally performing a bit better than the higher end, and re-sales performing better than new home sales. An authority on New Jersey's housing industry reports that market conditions remain weak: despite some uptick in resale transactions, the spring season, thus far, has been unusually slow. Brokers report that there have been more all-cash deals but also more distress sales. Sales and construction of new homes remain at exceptionally weak levels. A Buffalo-area real estate contact reports that selling prices have increased modestly from a year ago, but that sales activity has been mixed--brisk at the lower end of the market, with some sellers receiving multiple offers, but sluggish at the middle and upper ends of the market.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|4|Reports from business contacts suggest some broad-based improvement in the labor market. A major New York City employment agency reports a marked pickup in hiring activity in March and describes it as the best month in a number of years. The pickup has been most notable in financial and legal services but also in other areas, such as public relations and real estate. On the supply side, this contact notes that there are fewer candidates looking, and that more employed people are making moves. More generally, firms in both manufacturing and other sectors report a further pickup in both hiring activity and general business conditions in early March, and contacts remain optimistic about the near term outlook. A trucking-industry contact reports that shipping activity has picked up steadily in recent months, but that firms face rising costs from both rising energy prices and more stringent federal regulations. More broadly, firms in various industries report increasingly widespread increases in input prices, and some increase in selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|4|Bankers report decreased demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages, increased demand for commercial mortgages and no change in demand for commercial and industrial loans. The decrease was most prevalent for residential mortgages. Bankers indicate steady demand for refinancing. Respondents report no change in credit standards for consumer loans and a tightening of credit standards for the other loan categories. No banker reported an easing of credit standards in any category. Bankers report a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for residential mortgages but no change in spreads in the other loan categories. Respondents also note a decrease in the average deposit rate. Bankers report an uptick in delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans but no change in delinquency rates for the other loan categories.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|4|Consumer spending increased from the previous reporting period. Consumers continued to be drawn toward promotional items, now in part because they are dealing with the impact of higher food and energy prices on household budgets. The expiration of manufacturers' incentives contributed to a slight decline in auto sales in March. Auto dealers reported inventories were relatively low given the recent strength of sales. Contacts noted that potential production disruptions stemming from the events in Japan and the effects of rising gas prices on demand add a good deal of uncertainty to the outlook for the auto sector. Some dealers have already seen a shift in sales from new trucks to more fuel efficient vehicles.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|4|Business spending continued to increase in February and March. Inventories were little changed, overall, although a few contacts indicated increasing their inventories of raw materials in anticipation of further price increases in the coming months. Capital expenditures continued as planned with several manufacturers noting equipment purchases and other efficiency improving investments. Merger and acquisitions activity picked up some. Hiring increased with contacts adding both temporary and permanent employees. Job postings also increased, and manufacturers reiterated the difficulty in finding appropriately skilled workers. A large staffing firm reported solid growth in billable hours and a substantial increase in permanent placement and recruiting activity. Furthermore, a recruiting firm noted that small business' hiring plans are beginning to show signs of improving.
chicago|Construction and Real estate|2011|4|Construction activity was again subdued in February and March. Single-family homebuilders indicated that the spring building season was likely to be slower than previously anticipated. They also reported a drop in the contract conversion rate. Buyers appear to be waiting for home prices to stabilize from their recent declines and the availability of financing remains a concern. In the multifamily sector, several contacts reported developing strength in the rental market and a corresponding pick-up in conversions of condominiums into apartments. Nonresidential construction slightly improved. Contacts reported greater activity in both the institutional and industrial sectors, including from the healthcare and automotive industries. Commercial real estate conditions were marginally better with commercial rents flattening out and small improvements in vacancy rates.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|4|production continued to expand in February and March. Activity in the steel, auto, and heavy equipment sectors remained strong. Several contacts reported significant current order backlogs and firming second-quarter order books. Capacity utilization in these industries has increased, but ample idle capacity remains available. For example, a contact in the steel industry noted that active furnaces are operating at high rates of utilization while idled furnaces are expected to be brought back on-line only slowly this year given the high costs of reactivation and uncertainty in the outlook. Lead times continued to lengthen as supply chains were stretched further for some parts. In addition, concerns, and a great deal of uncertainty, were expressed about the potential impact of the Japanese disaster. Contacts expected that supply chain disruptions would take place, although it was too early to tell their full extent. Auto suppliers reported that shortages are most likely to occur first in parts such as electronics, as well as for parts that were already in short supply like tires. Some domestic suppliers have already seen increases in demand for their products as a result. Automakers reported that dealers' vehicle inventories were lean enough to make them consider adding shifts at existing plants; but if parts shortages arise, production schedules may be pared back now and made up as necessary later in the year.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|4|Credit conditions continued to improve in February and March. Banking contacts indicated that the business loan pipeline was still not robust, but that there were some areas of growth in manufacturing, food processing, and healthcare. Competition continued to be fierce for high-quality commercial and industrial loans (both large and small) leading to more aggressive terms and pricing. In addition, bank and non-bank investment in commercial real estate assets was also noted to be increasing. Consumer lending was little changed from the previous reporting period. Mortgage applications decreased and those made were primarily for purchase, as refinancing slowed with a rise in mortgage rates. Several contacts raised concerns about the impact that uncertainty surrounding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the regulatory environment were having on mortgage credit availability.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|4|Cost pressures rose in February and March. Wage pressures remained moderate, but raw materials prices increased. The most notable increases were for steel and other industrial metals, but the prices of plastics, paints, resins and cotton also rose. Fuel and transportation surcharges were also noted to be rising. Pass-through to downstream prices was moderate, however. Retailers indicated that they were trying to limit raising prices, though pass-through was noted to be increasing, particularly for food and energy-related items. In contrast, several manufacturing contacts reported an increase in pricing power, with less pushback from customers in accepting higher prices. Commercial builders have been able to pass along minimal price increases to offset some of their higher raw material costs, although residential builders have not been able to do so.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|4|Contacts predicted normal timing for the start of planting this year, and that fields were in good enough shape so that planting should proceed quickly. Ground moisture across the District is sufficient for a good start to the crop year, although some areas do not have adequate subsoil moisture to weather dry spells. More corn and fewer soybean acres were expected to be planted this year. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices were volatile, but on net edged lower during the reporting period. With stocks lower than a year ago, contacts saw the potential for upward pressure on corn and soybean prices in coming months. Moreover, feed mills have been actively seeking alternatives to blend into livestock rations. Milk prices continued to rise. Hog and cattle prices moved higher, with premiums being offered to attract the delivery of more animals for slaughter.
dallas|Prices|2011|4|Price pressures continued to build since the last report. Many responding firms said high fuel prices were causing their input costs to rise, and contacts in the lumber and transportation services industries increased selling prices in response. Some manufacturers noted steel prices had risen, and most construction respondents said metal and petroleum based products, such as rebar, copper and asphalt had increased in price. In the service sector, airline fares were up significantly due to increases in the price of jet fuel. Legal contacts noted slight increases in billing rates, and retailers continued to report upticks in food prices.
dallas|Labor Market|2011|4|There were increased reports of hiring activity compared with the previous reporting period. Staffing firms continued to note strong demand and were hiring for their own needs at a stronger pace than in the last report. Some transportation, food and primary metals manufacturers reported employment increases. A few contacts in the auto sales, railroad and airline sectors also noted a rise in hiring activity. Wage pressures were minimal, although some fabricated metals contacts were considering increases.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|4|Demand for construction-related products improved slightly, according to most contacts. Even after accounting for pent-up demand following bad weather in early February, cement, glass and primary metals firms and some lumber manufacturers reported some increase in activity. Apartment construction, residential repair and remodeling, and custom commercial projects were said to be driving the uptick. Fabricated metals producers said orders rose, but at a slightly slower pace. While overall activity is at low levels, most construction-related manufacturers' outlooks were more optimistic than they were six weeks ago, although there were some concerns regarding recent world events.
dallas|Retail Sales|2011|4|Eleventh District retail sales rebounded from weather-related sluggishness in the previous reporting period and grew modestly compared to the prior year. Home furnishings sales benefitted from strong seasonal trends. According to one large retailer, the Eleventh District continues to grow at a stronger pace than the nation, on average. Expectations are for a modest improvement in 2011 over 2010.
dallas|Services|2011|4|Staffing firms said demand held steady at high levels. Strength remains broad-based, with particularly strong demand coming from the steel, oil, customer service, IT and professional industries. All contacts had positive outlooks and expect continued strength in 2011.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2011|4|Eleventh District housing activity remains weak, and contacts expect more of the same in the coming months. Outlooks for the second half of the year were slightly more upbeat. Respondents said the first-time homebuyer market continues to deteriorate, but some realtors and builders said higherâ€end homes sales had increased modestly.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|4|Financial firms reported a slight improvement in overall loan demand. National banks reported some pickup in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan demand with increased corporate activity, while they continue to see weakness in commercial real estate (CRE). Regional banks noted that loan demand remains pretty flat, although there was a small increase in optimism regarding homebuilding and some CRE lending at the community-bank level. Most contacts said loan pricing remains aggressive amidst a highly competitive lending landscape. Outlooks are gradually improving in light of better outstanding loan quality and continued slow progress in lending conditions.
dallas|Energy|2011|4|Drilling activity remained strong in Texas since the last report, with the state accounting for much of the increase in the U.S. rig count. The trend toward more oil-directed drilling continues. Although fewer rigs are directed to natural gas, those drilling for gas provide high levels of activity for service companies according to respondents. Contacts noted growing backlogs for horizontal drilling equipment and for crews used for both oil and natural gas activity.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|4|Drought conditions became more widespread in March, covering more than 90 percent of the district. Hay production was down and wheat and oat crop conditions were poor. The lack of soil moisture is a large concern for spring crops, although planting was underway and mostly on schedule. Demand for agricultural products remained strong. Commodity and beef prices generally moved up, with scattered reports of rising food prices at the retail level. Input costs such as fuel, fertilizer and feed have risen, pushing up the cost of crop and livestock production.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|4|Manufacturing activity has increased since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or reduce operations. Firms in the silicone products, rubber products, and military vehicle manufacturing industries reported plans to expand existing operations and hire new workers. Additionally, firms in the electrical equipment and automobile parts manufacturing industries reported plans to open new plants in the District. In contrast, firms in the food, surgical instrument, packaging, and weapons manufacturing industries announced plans to decrease operations and lay off employees.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|4|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, February 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 6 percent in Louisville, 8 percent in St. Louis and Memphis, and 14 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction declined throughout the District as well. February 2011 year-to-date single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 25 percent in Little Rock, 40 percent in St. Louis, 2 percent in Memphis, and 20 percent in Louisville.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|4|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 3.2 percent in the three-month period from mid-December to mid-March. Real estate lending, which accounts for 74.9 percent of total loans, decreased 1.3 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.4 percent of total loans, decreased 8.7 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 5.0 percent of loans, decreased 2.6 percent. All other loans decreased 16.7 percent and accounted for 4.7 percent of total loans. Over this period, total deposits decreased 1.7 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|4|Commercial red meat production in the Eighth District rose by 0.2 percent in February 2011, compared with February 2010, while year-to-date production at the end of February 2011 was 2 percent higher compared with the same period in 2010. Year-to-date estimates for the number of chickens slaughtered and for total live weight at the end of February 2011 were 2.3 percent and 3.7 percent higher, respectively, compared with 2010 figures. The District's year-to-date coal production at the end of February 2011 was 8.5 percent higher than in the same period in 2010.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|4|More than half of Third District manufacturers reported increases in shipments and new orders in March -- a stronger response than in February. Producers across a broad spectrum of 13 manufacturing sectors reported increased demand. The strongest reports came out of the fabricated metal products and industrial machinery and equipment sectors. Declines in orders were predominant only among producers of apparel and rubber products. While several manufacturers cited existing customers as the source of increased orders, other sources included new product offerings and expanding international opportunities.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|4|Third District retailers generally reported slight year-over-year increases in sales in March. One merchant said, "Things are getting a little better, but there is no move to stronger growth." ers indicated that sales of furniture and home goods have risen recently, but sales of spring apparel have been slow to pick up, which retailers attributed to unseasonably cold weather and the late Easter date this year. Some retailers said they have experienced shortages of a few goods produced by Japanese companies, mainly electronic products, but as of late March there did not appear to be a widespread interruption of imports of consumer goods from the Far East. Store executives surveyed for this report expect the current modest rate of sales growth to continue through the spring.
philadelphia|Finance|2011|4|Total outstanding loan volume at most of the Third District banks contacted for this report has shown little change in recent weeks. Some banks in the region reported recent increases in lending extended on home equity credit lines, but other forms of consumer credit have been level or moved down. Some banks reported increases in commercial and industrial loans and some types of commercial real estate loans. One banker said, "We're making more small business loans, and commercial real estate lending is picking up except for retail properties." The outlook among Third District bankers interviewed for this report is that total loan volume will expand slowly this year, as overall economic activity advances, with gains mostly in commercial and industrial and consumer lending, but lending for residential or commercial construction is not expected to increase.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|4|Residential real estate activity has shown some signs of picking up in most parts of the Third District. Real estate agents reported a recent increase in inquiries from prospective buyers of existing homes. A common comment from agents was that "showings are up." Several agents noted that the inventory of existing homes for sale is below the level of a year ago. Agents expect sales to pick up by the usual seasonal amount this spring, and some said they thought a stronger than usual gain might be attained. However, agents generally expect sales prices to be level with or slightly below prices recorded a year ago. Sales of new homes do not appear to have increased notably in the region, according to local builders. Some contractors reported a rise in remodeling and renovation work, but they also noted that rainy weather has caused delays in this activity in recent weeks.
philadelphia|Services|2011|4|Service-sector firms generally reported increases in activity since the previous Beige Book; however, for most of those contacted in March, the monthly and year-over-year gains have been modest. Firms providing services to businesses as well as those providing services to consumers indicated that activity has been advancing slightly as a result of both increases in customers and per-customer usage. Most of the service-sector firms contacted for this report expect growth to continue at around its recent pace; few expect growth to accelerate in the near future. One contact expressed the opinion of most in saying, "The cycle has turned up, but our customers are being very cautious about increases in spending."
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|4|Reports from manufacturers since the previous Beige Book continue to indicate rising factor prices, especially for energy inputs. Far fewer manufacturers report raising output prices, while a few indicate resistance to hikes from their customers, if not expectations of discounts. Retailers generally indicated that selling prices have been steady, although some reported that they have raised apparel prices in response to higher wholesale costs. Auto dealers reported continuing high prices for used cars and recent increases in prices for new cars. Although the predominant view among Third District firms is that overall inflation will move higher, slightly fewer firms expressed that view compared to reports from the last Beige Book. Nevertheless, several firms in the region said they have implemented hedges or signed forward contracts for motor fuels.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|4|Consumer spending picked up modestly across most Districts since the last report. Consumers were shopping for necessities and looking for lower-priced options or promotional items in the Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. New York reported strong retail sales in February and March, but noted weaker sales at two major retail chains in New York. Retailers in the Cleveland District reported higher sales relative to a year ago, although a few contacts cited considerable stress in the low- to mid-market segments. Richmond reported weak sales, including for big-ticket items, and Boston received mixed sales reports. Big-ticket sales, particularly for home furnishings, picked up in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts, but remained subdued in the San Francisco District.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|4|Non-financial service firms generally reported expansion, although Minneapolis and Atlanta heard mixed reports. Demand for business-to-business services increased in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Boston and Minneapolis cited stronger demand for advertising and marketing services. In addition, respondents in several Districts reported higher demand for seasonal accounting services. Contacts at firms providing travel-related services in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts also reported an uptick in demand. Kansas City District restaurateurs said sales were up, but the average check amount had declined; in contrast, restaurant contacts in the Atlanta District gave mixed reports and some in the St. Louis District planned to decrease operations.
summary|Manufacturing|2011|4|All twelve Districts reported that manufacturing activity increased since their previous reports. Ten of the twelve Districts cited a further pickup in production, while Cleveland and Dallas observed steady to slightly improving activity. Dallas said overall demand in manufacturing rose slightly from low levels, noting gains in food, plastics, and construction-related products. Richmond and Chicago reported substantial increases in auto and auto parts manufacturing. Cleveland indicated that auto production overall dipped slightly, but that domestic automakers showed a substantial rise in production. Moreover, St. Louis mentioned that automobile parts and electrical equipment manufacturers reported plans to open new plants in their District. Boston and Kansas City reported that growth of high-tech goods was strong, but several contacts in the Dallas District said that high-tech shipments to Japanese factories declined. Boston and Richmond District respondents attributed a lack of new contracts from federal government agencies to the uncertainties surrounding the budget for fiscal year 2011. San Francisco reported that makers of commercial aircraft and related parts had modest growth in new orders, which they attributed in part to increased demand for aircraft with greater fuel efficiency. Philadelphia said that manufacturers of fabricated metal products and industrial machinery cited higher demand. Similarly, steel producers and metal service centers in the Cleveland District reported that shipping volume met or exceeded expectations, with shipments driven by energy-related, transportation, and heavy equipment.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|4|Real estate markets for single family homes for the most part either were little changed from low levels or continued to weaken across all Districts. Residential construction was described by Chicago as subdued and the spring building season is likely to be slower than previously anticipated. Market activity was still declining in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, while activity in the New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts remained weak. Atlanta characterized the market as mixed, with Florida brokers providing most of the signs of improvement. Both Philadelphia and Atlanta noted that brokers expected the market to improve, and builders in the Cleveland District were more optimistic than in the past several months. A few Districts found pockets of improvement. For example, Philadelphia reported that agents were seeing a pickup in inquiries, showings, and traffic, although there was little increase in sales or construction. Boston noted higher activity in just the last few weeks, due in part to improved weather, and Richmond said that the market for lower-priced homes improved. The multifamily markets strengthened in several Districts, including Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, both in terms of leasing and construction activity.
summary|Banking and Financial Services|2011|4|Most Districts cited loan demand as either unchanged or slightly improved since the last report, although many of the Districts citing improvements noted weak demand in some market segments. Banks in the Chicago District noted that their pipeline was still not robust, although manufacturing, food processing, and healthcare experienced some growth. Cleveland reported that business lending was strongest in healthcare and in energy. Consumer loan demand showed some improvement in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, but was little changed in the Chicago District. Overall loan demand was weak or little changed in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts, although Philadelphia noted some improvement in commercial and industrial loans and in some types of commercial real estate loans. However, New York described household demand (for both consumer loans and mortgages) as weakening in its District, and St. Louis noted declines across most segments of its market, including real estate, commercial and industrial, and personal loans.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|4|Most Districts reported that labor market conditions were generally stronger than in their last reports. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all noted increased employment activity, while Boston and Atlanta reported modest or gradual improvement. However, Philadelphia, Cleveland and San Francisco mentioned limited or delayed hiring, while labor market conditions were mixed in the St. Louis District. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas cited noticeable improvements in the manufacturing sector, and Boston and Kansas observed increased labor demand in the technology sector. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis received upbeat reports from staffing agencies. New York said that a major employment agency experienced a marked pickup in hiring activity in March, describing it as "the best month in years." A staffing contact in the Cleveland District noted moderate growth in the number of new job openings, with vacancies concentrated in health care, energy and professional business services. A large staffing firm in the Chicago District reported solid growth in billable hours and a substantial increase in permanent placement and recruiting activity, while contacts in the Philadelphia District were inclined to delay additions to permanent or temporary staff. Employers in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts said that they were experiencing difficulty in recruiting highly specialized workers. Despite signs of improvement in most labor markets, St. Louis and Minneapolis reported examples of layoffs in the manufacturing sector of their regions.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|4|Assessments of agricultural activity were mixed. Varying degrees of drought conditions persisted in the Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, with Chicago indicating that some areas in their District did not have adequate subsoil moisture to endure dry spells. In the Kansas City District, agricultural growing conditions generally worsened in late February and March. In particular, winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further as the drought in the southern Plains intensified. Dallas reported that drought conditions became more widespread in March, covering more than 90 percent of the District. However, Dallas noted that planting was underway despite concern about the lack of soil moisture for spring crops. Chicago also indicated that planting should proceed quickly in most of the District, as fields were in good condition with ground moisture sufficient for an excellent start to the crop year. Moreover, the Minneapolis District continued to enjoy good conditions in spite of wet weather and spring flooding. Most Districts reported that prices of fuel and feed continued to put downward pressure on margins, but prices for most agricultural commodities remained strong. Atlanta said that strong global demand contributed to elevated prices for some farm acreage, while Kansas City attributed higher farmland values to strong crop prices and a limited number of farms for sale.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|4|activity continued to expand at a solid pace in March. An auto-parts supplier said that orders at his plant had increased beyond available capacity and he indicated that lead times had increased due to the scarcity of materials. He mentioned that levels of inventories were much lower than desired, and in some cases were nonexistent, causing backlogs of orders for both aftermarket and service parts. Similarly, a packaging manufacturer told us that vendor delay in selected raw materials had affected his company, and he described transportation costs as a growing worry. A manufacturer of dental equipment reported an increase in business throughout his company; he noted that the gains included existing and new accounts. In contrast, several manufacturers who supply products to federal government agencies attributed the lack of new contracts to the uncertainties surrounding the budget for fiscal year 2011, but they expected that business would return to normal once the federal spending issues are resolved. Several textile contacts reported that uncertainty in their raw material markets, exacerbated by the turmoil in the Middle East, had caused prices in petroleum-based products to escalate. More broadly, raw materials prices continued to move higher, according to our latest survey.
richmond|Retail|2011|4|District retail sales remained anemic in recent weeks. A store manager at a discount chain department store in central North Carolina noted, "Sales petered out after early tax refunds were spent," while the store manager at another discount chain store in Virginia Beach said sales were "slow but steady." Suppliers' prices rose rapidly for cotton and petroleum-based fabrics. At a Maryland mall, a department store manager told us that rising cotton prices were "a big deal," preventing acquisition of inventory such as clothing, sheets, and towels. An analyst for a major hardware store chain stated that sales were "a little better," with shoppers spending more but not on major home improvements. Big-ticket sales weakened, according to surveyed contacts, primarily in wholesale construction materials and furniture. Vehicle sales were generally sluggish or unchanged; a dealer in the Tidewater area of Virginia reported "sales have been stagnant." Another dealer reported that he was facing restrictions on ordering certain car colors, because those paints come from Japan; he also noted availability problems with car components originating in Japan.  prices rose at a slightly quicker pace in recent weeks; a large grocer indicated that his wholesale price increases were being passed through to consumers.
richmond|Services|2011|4|Revenues grew more rapidly at services-providing establishments since our last report. CPAs and tax-preparation services reported strong seasonal demand. Internet service businesses, as well as travel-related services providers, also noted higher revenues. A contact at a building maintenance firm cited a recent uptick in modernization spending, especially among large hotels, causing increased backlogs at his company. Healthcare contacts indicated that demand for their services was generally unchanged in recent weeks, as did business-to-business services such as management consultants. An exception was freight trucking; contacts with a nationwide presence stated that business was strengthening and that they were doing some hiring. The pace of price increases in the sector edged up, according to survey responses.
richmond|Finance|2011|4|Banking activity picked up across the District. Most bank officials whom we contacted noted a marked increase in interest from business clients, often to restart projects that had been delayed over the past two years. Several bankers also reported that their lending had grown from weak levels at the end of last year. A Virginia banker stated that consumer demand, while still quite soft, had improved, while a Richmond banker in a relatively affluent neighborhood cited a spike in equity line usage (often to be used for pre-sale home renovations). Most commercial bankers reported that small business lending had strengthened somewhat, with much of the funds going to equipment upgrades and plant expansions. A bank official in West Virginia reported that auto dealer inventory financing increased, but overall the bank's loan pipeline was slack and he was unenthusiastic about loan demand in general. Reports on mortgage lending activity were mixed.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|4|Real estate activity edged up since our last report. Several Realtors indicated that sales were picking up gradually and that markets were more active than a year ago when tax credit programs were still in place. Most contacts indicated that sales in the low-price range fared much better than sales in the upper ranges. In contrast, an agent in the D.C. area stated that sales in the $700 thousand to $900 thousand price range increased over 80 percent, and sales in the one-million-plus price range were up over 100 percent. While most Realtors indicated that that they had not seen any change in the proportion of distressed sales, a contact in Greensboro, North Carolina noticed an increase in foreclosures and an agent in Fredericksburg mentioned that short sales were still about 50 percent of that market. Realtors throughout the District noted an increase in foot traffic, but sale price movements varied. Real estate agents in the D.C. and Greenville, South Carolina areas stated that prices held steady, while a contact in Greensboro said prices were soft. In contrast, an agent in Fredericksburg, Virginia reported that sales prices rose about 10 percent over last year, and an agent in the D.C. area reported upward price momentum due to lower inventory. He noted that properties in top condition and priced at market were selling quickly and that recent sales were generating four to five offers at full price and above.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|4|Labor markets generally strengthened across most sectors in the Fifth District, with the exception of construction and retail. Several employment agencies reported somewhat stronger demand for temporary help in recent weeks, particularly in automotive and other manufacturing sectors. The branch manager of a temp agency in Raleigh and an agent in Hickory, North Carolina reported an increase in demand for skilled workers for the manufacturing and automotive industries. In Charlotte, North Carolina, an employment agent indicated that hiring was on the rebound and that his firm would soon add internal recruiters and account managers. Most recruiters expected rising demand for employees over the next six months. However, many contacts mentioned that skill levels of applicants often fell short, despite recent government actions to improve education and training for displaced workers. According to our latest survey, wages in the retail sector increased on average, although gains were somewhat less widespread than in our last report; the pace of wage increases picked up at services firms.
richmond|Tourism|2011|4|District hotels, including resorts, reported an uptick in bookings for April, as well as strong advance bookings for the summer vacation season. The manager of a resort hotel in the North Carolina Piedmont region expected a good summer season, and he indicated April bookings were up slightly year-over-year. Our contact at a resort in western Virginia reported an increase in dollar volume, year-over-year. He said, "'Staycations' are here for the long-haul," with many of his advance-booked leisure guests coming from within a day's drive. A contact on the North Carolina Outer Banks reported that rentals were up in most categories for the summer ahead, and good spring weather had boosted April cottage rentals. She stated that people seemed to be feeling a little better about the economy and were focusing on spending time with family. A Washington, DC contact reported that early attendance at this year's Cherry Blossom Festival was above average and that cooler temperatures meant that blooms would last longer, giving visitors more opportunity to enjoy the cherry trees in bloom.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|4|Consumer spending picked up following weather-reduced sales in the last survey period. After firming in late February and March, retailers expected sales to rise in the next three months. Store managers noted an uptick in sales of apparel and decorative items. One jewelry store, however, noted that high gasoline prices were cutting disposable incomes and trimming sales. After slowing in the last survey, auto dealers reported robust sales, particularly for used cars, fuel efficient vehicles, and SUVs. Dealers were optimistic that sales would rebound further. Restaurant operators reported stronger sales despite a continued decline in the average check amount. Tourism activity edged up, and vacation destinations were hiring for the summer. Colorado resorts reported the number of skiers this season exceeded year-ago levels. Some District hoteliers raised room rates in response to higher occupancy rates.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|4|District manufacturing activity expanded rapidly and business activity for high-tech service and transportation firms improved in late February and March. Factory managers reported a surge in production and shipments at both durable and non-durable goods plants. New orders jumped in March, boosting order backlogs as firms replenished finished goods inventories. Raw material inventories rose with some reports of stockpiling to meet anticipated demand and to protect against further price increases. Expectations for future factory orders, production, and shipments remained positive. Some manufacturers were hiring workers, and others expanded the average work week. After softening in the last survey period, sales rose at high-tech service and transportation firms with further improvements expected. Transportation companies struggled to find qualified drivers, and some high-tech firms had difficulty filling specialized positions, such as software developers. With brisk demand, factories and high-tech service firms ramped up capital spending and planned additional hiring.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|4|Residential real estate activity remained slow with subdued growth prospects, while commercial real estate activity stabilized with expectations for improvement. Home building edged down since the last survey period, and construction supply sales were below expectations. Even with a seasonal upturn in residential home sales, the inventory of unsold homes grew substantially as more homes were placed on the market and real estate agents anticipated further home price declines. Driven by less demand for refinancing, mortgage loan activity plummeted, and builders noted the mortgage loan approval process was taking longer. After falling in the last survey period, commercial construction activity picked up modestly and was expected to hold steady over the next three months. District commercial real estate contacts reported an uptick in sales with stable prices and rents. Office and multifamily property leasing was particularly strong. Vacancy rates remained elevated but were expected to move lower as absorption rates gradually improved.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|4|In the recent survey period, bankers reported weaker loan demand, but also rising deposits and improvements in loan quality. Overall loan demand decreased as demand for commercial and industrial, residential real estate, consumer installment, and commercial real estate loans declined. For the fifth straight survey, credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories. Deposits increased further in the recent survey period. Bankers also reported improvements in loan quality compared to a year ago, and they expected further improvements over the next six months.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|4|Agricultural growing conditions worsened in late February and March, but farm income and farmland values strengthened. Winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further as drought conditions in the southern Plains intensified. While farmers are expected to plant more acres to corn and soybeans this spring, crop prices continued to rise as robust food and bio-fuel demand was expected to strain global supplies. Livestock prices strengthened with rising demand and stronger exports, preserving profits despite higher feed costs. Producers continued to pay off loans, shrinking loan demand. Lenders, however, expected a modest rebound in demand for farm operating loans before spring planting and indicated ample funds were available for qualified borrowers. Farmland prices rose further with strong crop prices and a limited number of farms for sale.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|4|District energy activity rose since the last survey period with plans for further expansion in the coming months. District contacts reported increased drilling activity, with exploration shifting away from natural gas towards crude oil. While many energy companies were hiring, some indicated that a lack of qualified labor and limited availability of equipment and services could constrain future drilling activity. Natural gas prices held steady at the close of the winter heating season but were expected to fall as inventory levels were considered sufficient. Crude oil prices rose sharply in late February and March, and contacts felt that political and economic instability in some producer nations would keep prices high for the near future. Ethanol profits held steady as rising ethanol prices offset higher costs of corn inputs. The Bureau of Land Management announced plans to conduct competitive lease sales of coal land in the Powder River Basin that will provide additional production for Wyoming's coal industry.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|4|Wages generally held steady even with expanded hiring, and more firms planned to increase selling prices, especially in industries where input prices have surged. Of the companies that added staff, most were not offering higher salaries to attract applicants. With the exception of highly competitive or specialized positions, wage pressures were expected to remain contained. Many District manufacturers reported another jump in raw materials prices, and some companies had already raised finished goods prices with more firms planning to do so in the coming months. Several construction suppliers and transportation companies reported fuel and delivery surcharges were common, and higher input costs were often being passed through to customer prices. Some restaurants increased menu prices in reaction to higher food costs, and some hotels raised room rates. District retailers also expected an uptick in selling prices with stronger consumer demand.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|1|Price inflation remained quite limited for most final goods and services during the reporting period. Contacts noted recent price increases for selected commodities such as oil and for assorted food items at the retail level, in particular for meat. However, intense supplier competition for existing customers kept a lid on final sales prices for the majority of retail goods and services.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|1|Retail sales were up compared with last year's holiday season, with gains reported by traditional department stores as well as discount chains. Inventories generally were at or near desired levels given the pace of sales, although contacts reported an excess of winter apparel resulting from unusually mild weather. Demand remained largely unchanged compared with prior reporting periods for retailers of major appliances, furniture, and electronics. Sales improved somewhat for grocers. Sales of new automobiles rose further overall during the reporting period, although slightly softer demand was noted for the last few weeks. Demand for used vehicles remained robust, and dealers reported marked improvement in the quality of trade-ins compared with earlier in the year.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|1|District manufacturing activity expanded further on balance during the reporting period of late November through the end of December. Makers of commercial aircraft and parts reported further expansion in production activity, with ongoing growth in new orders attributed in part to rising demand for fuel-efficient aircraft. Activity remained largely stable for metal fabricators and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. For manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, demand growth continued to slow, and capacity utilization dipped a bit from existing high levels as companies sought to hold down inventory growth. Capacity utilization rates for petroleum refiners remained largely stable or rose somewhat as robust global demand for distillate products, such as diesel and jet fuel, offset weak domestic demand for gasoline. Activity remained exceptionally sluggish for manufacturers of wood products.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|1|Demand was robust for agricultural producers and grew a bit for natural resources used for energy production. Final sales and orders for most agricultural products, including livestock and a variety of crops, continued to expand. Elevated price levels for a range of metals supported further expansion of mining activity in parts of the District. Overall demand for crude oil rose slightly, largely reflecting robust foreign demand, while mild winter weather has kept demand for natural gas subdued and caused extraction activity to wane a bit.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|1|Home demand in the District remained at very low levels, and demand for commercial real estate stayed weak. The sales pace for new and existing homes was somewhat mixed across the District but sluggish overall. In response to slow sales and continued high numbers of financially distressed properties, home construction activity remained moribund and prices were mostly flat. Demand for commercial real estate remained weak overall, keeping vacancy rates for office and industrial space elevated in most parts of the District. However, in selected geographic areas, such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, expansion in the information technology sector continued to spur demand growth for office and industrial space.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|1|Reports from District banking contacts indicated that loan demand improved a touch relative to the prior reporting period. The volume of new commercial and industrial loans inched up, although contacts noted that businesses remain very cautious in their approach to capital spending. Contacts again noted stiff competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses, causing sustained downward pressure on loan rates and fees. Contacts from the venture capital sector noted a slight pickup in IPO and investment activity, on the heels of a slowdown in the prior reporting period. On the consumer side, loan demand remained largely unchanged. In general, lending standards stayed relatively restrictive for many types of business and consumer loans, despite further modest improvements in overall credit quality.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2012|1|As in mid-November, retail contacts for this round report a slight improvement in business conditions from earlier in the year. Comparable-store sales in the fourth quarter for most contacts range from flat to up 2 percent from a year earlier; one retailer saw a drop in in-store foot traffic for December but a tripling in Internet sales. One is projecting annual sales for 2011 will be down about 5 percent, but this represents an improvement compared with sales declines of 10 percent in the first half of the year. Contacts with a web-based presence report sales strength in this area, and some are adding staff and making investments to better service customers buying online. Planned salary increases for 2012 range from 2 percent to 3 percent for merit-related raises; none of the retail contacts is planning to offer a cost-of-living adjustment.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|1|Not much has changed since our last manufacturing report in mid-November. Most contacts report growing sales and some are hiring, albeit in small numbers. Two contacts in the semiconductor industry report a substantial weakening of business in the summer and fall but both seem optimistic that the decline is transitory. Overall, the mood remains cautious.
boston|Selected Business Services|2012|1|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report strong growth in the fourth quarter after a generally weaker third quarter. Marketing and advertising contacts indicate that 2011 growth has averaged 8 percent to 9 percent (annual rate), driven largely by an increase in large orders from large clients. Strategy and business consulting contacts report low double-digit annualized growth, driven by strong private equity business, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate consulting. Contacts note that many clients have a lot of cash and are becoming more confident that--despite risks--the U.S. economy will "muddle through" and thus are willing to spend. In addition, consulting firms have seen a shift in demand towards services that can be directly tied to the bottom line such as sales and process efficiency rather than strategy and management.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|1|Commercial leasing activity across the First District was flat to down in recent weeks, in line with typical seasonal patterns. In Hartford, leasing activity saw a modest seasonal slowdown in December and business sentiment held steady. Activity slowed modestly in Providence as well, also in line with year-end expectations, but deals in the works as of the previous report moved forward as expected and pending deals are set to boost absorption of Class A office space in the first quarter of 2012. Greater Portland also registered a modest seasonal leasing slowdown in December, but saw a decline in the office vacancy rate on a year-over-year basis, to 10.8 percent from 11.2 percent. Boston's leasing market held roughly steady, with modest positive absorption in suburban corridors as well as in the sought-after neighborhoods of Back Bay and East Cambridge. Rents remain flat for downtown office space on lower floors of buildings but are rising for upper-floor space in prime high-rise structures. Despite positive absorption in 2011, one contact says Boston's downtown office vacancy rate remains undesirably high at about 16 percent.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|1|Sales figures in the New England single-family home and condominium market increased in November compared to a year ago, with the growth largely reflecting lackluster year-earlier sales numbers following the expiration of the tax credit in mid-2010. Contacts reiterated concerns about weak demand, citing poor labor market conditions and stricter lending requirements. A contact from Greater Boston contrasts the local market with the rest of the New England region, saying that the Greater Boston area showed possible signs of improvement due to strengthening employment conditions in the city. Meanwhile, throughout New England, the median sale price of homes and condos fell in November compared to a year ago; contacts attribute the declines to a rise in sales of distressed properties. The price decreases were uneven across the region, with Maine slipping by less than 1 percent and Connecticut prices falling by over 10 percent. The median price of condos fell more sharply than home prices.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|1|Consumer spending increased during the holiday season. Holiday sales at a Minneapolis area mall were up more than 10 percent compared with a year ago. Sales at a North Dakota mall during late November and December were up about 8 percent over last year. A mall manager in Montana noted heavy traffic at the mall during the week before Christmas and the day after Christmas. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased about 2 percent in November compared with a year ago; Black Friday sales were particularly strong. A Minnesota-based sporting goods store reported that Internet sales on Cyber Monday (Nov. 28) increased 50 percent over last year. Warm weather set back some sales of winter apparel, but clear roads allowed shoppers to get to stores. A domestic auto dealer reported strong sales in December.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|1|Commercial construction activity decreased modestly over the past year. The value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was down slightly in November from November 2010. Respondents to the University of St. Thomas's semiannual Minnesota Commercial Real Estate Survey (November) expected higher land and building costs, which should dampen construction. However, several commercial construction projects are under way or planned in Montana. Residential construction decreased from last year. The number of permitted residential units in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Sioux Falls, and Billings, Mont., areas was down in November from a year ago, but increased in Fargo, N.D.
minneapolis|Services|2012|1|Activity at professional business services firms increased since the last report. An information technology consulting firm noted a solid backlog of business for 2012. An architectural firm noted more potential projects up for bid, but said many projects never become reality. An accounting firm reported flat activity over the past month.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|1|The District manufacturing sector expanded slightly since the last report. A November survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and North Dakota, and was flat in South Dakota. A number of factory expansions were reported in eastern South Dakota, including at a plastics producer and a packaging firm. In southern Minnesota, a firm that produces pressurized storage tanks for the natural gas industry is expanding into a currently empty building, and a large plant that makes electronically shaded glass began operations after several years of development.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2012|1|Activity in the energy and mining sectors continued to increase. A new wind energy project was announced in western Wisconsin. While District oil and gas exploration activity decreased slightly since the last report, it remained well above year-earlier levels. An oil transport facility expansion is planned in North Dakota that will add a rail car loading area and increase holding capacity by 80,000 barrels per day. Mining activity remained strong. A new venture on Minnesota's Iron Range to extract material for steel production from old mining dumps recently began operations at one site and made its first shipments; two more sites are planned.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|1|Growth in the agricultural sector moderated, as some commodity prices declined. Prices received by farmers for wheat, corn, hogs, and dairy products decreased in December from the previous month. Cattle, poultry, egg, dry bean, and hay prices increased in December from the previous month. Meanwhile, a partnership announced the development of a large grain-loading facility in Minnesota.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|1|Labor markets showed continued signs of modest strengthening. A pharmacy benefits management company recently announced plans to add 300 jobs in Minnesota. A bank is hiring almost 80 more workers at a call center in South Dakota. Bank directors noted that in the Dakotas and some parts of Montana, employers would hire if they could find workers; some of these employers have started to offer relocation packages as an incentive. According to a recent survey by an employment services firm, 15 percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul expect to increase staffing levels during first quarter 2012, while 8 percent expect to decrease staff. A year ago, 10 percent expected to increase hiring, while 6 percent expected decreases. Minnesota initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased 18 percent in November compared with a year earlier.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|1|New orders and production at District factories were mainly stable during the past six weeks. Any declines were attributed to seasonal factors or lessening demand from European and Chinese customers. Compared to year-ago levels, the majority of our contacts noted a moderate improvement in output. However, they are cautious in their outlook and expect little change in demand during the upcoming months. Most steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume was steady along seasonal trends, although two of our contacts noted an unexpected pickup for this time of year. Demand is being driven by autos, energy, and heavy equipment industries. Steel representatives are hopeful about the first quarter of 2012, and most expect to see at least modest growth. District auto production showed a substantial decline during November on a month-over-month basis, more so for foreign nameplates. Most of the decline was attributed to supply chain issues. Year-over-year, domestic auto producers' output rose significantly, while their foreign counterparts posted moderate declines.
cleveland|Construction|2012|1|Single-family home construction was described as better during the past couple of months, with sales contracts distributed across all price-point categories. Builders were slightly more optimistic in their outlook, but they are not expecting an industry turnaround in the near term. We heard a report that homebuilders' inventories are on a decline in some parts of the District, which should help boost new-home construction during 2012. Not much change was seen in the list prices of new homes, though two of our contacts noted a greater use of discounting. A few subcontractors attempted to raise billing rates, but they were unsuccessful. Employment and wages were stable.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|1|Retailers reported that November sales were stable or slightly higher relative to October sales. According to a few of our contacts, a milder than expected autumn was holding back purchases of cold weather-related items, while purchases of electronics and home furnishings were better than expected. On a year-over-year basis, results were mixed. Sales for the first quarter of 2012 are generally expected to improve over prior-year levels, mainly in the low- to mid-single digits. Some retailers expressed caution about 2012 given the fragility of household balance sheets. Upward pressure on supplier costs has abated during the past six weeks. Inventories were characterized as good except for apparel items, which are higher than desired. Capital budgets were on plan. Most of our contacts said that outlays during 2012 will not change appreciably from this year's levels and that outlays will be used mainly for technology enhancements and remodeling. Other than seasonal hiring, there was little change in employment at existing stores.
cleveland|Banking|2012|1|Demand for business loans was characterized as either stable or increasing. Requests are being driven by commercial real estate, notably multifamily housing, and healthcare. On the consumer side, our contacts described installment loan activity as flat or up a bit. Auto lending (direct and indirect) and home equity lines of credit continued to show strength. Bankers said that they have not seen a bump up in the use of credit cards during the holiday shopping season. Interest rates for business and consumer credit were very competitive. Activity in the residential mortgage market has been solid in the fourth quarter, driven by low interest rates. Most applicants are looking to refinance. No changes were made to loan application standards. Delinquencies were steady or declined across most loan categories; any stress was found in real estate portfolios and credit cards. Overall core deposits grew, although a few bankers commented that growth is being driven by business customers. Payrolls were stable, with little hiring expected in the near term.
cleveland|Energy|2012|1|Conventional oil and natural gas production was mainly steady during the past few weeks, with little change expected in the upcoming months. Our contacts were uncertain about future gas drilling due to eroding natural gas prices. Well-head prices for oil were flat, but remained elevated. Activity in shale-gas extraction expanded. Coal output was stable, though it may decline during 2012 due to an easing in demand for thermal and metallurgical coals from European customers and domestic power producers. The latter was attributed to abundant supplies of low-priced natural gas and regulatory compliance issues for coal-fired generators. Spot prices for several types of coal have fallen off. Capital outlays are on target, with moderate increases projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming months. The cost of production equipment and materials was generally flat during the past six weeks.  payrolls held steady. A few small oil and gas producers are beginning to experience wage pressures brought on by competition from large firms engaged in shale gas exploration and production.
cleveland|Transportation|2012|1|Freight transport volume has slowed during the past few weeks, following seasonal trends. Strong demand was still seen from the energy and manufacturing sectors. Our contacts expect volume to grow at a slow, steady pace during 2012, with predictions in the mid-single digits. We heard numerous reports of rising prices for parts, especially tires, and of some volatility in fuel prices. Much of the cost increase was recovered via fuel surcharges and rate adjustments when contracts came due. Capital outlays were on plan for 2011. Most of our contacts expect to increase their capital budgets during 2012 for fleet expansion and to replace aging equipment. Operators reported hiring for driver replacement or adding capacity, although recruiting qualified drivers is difficult. Wage pressures exist due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|1|District retail contacts noted that sales and traffic in late November and December were up from a year ago. Post-Thanksgiving reports were generally positive; nearly sixty percent of contacts polled indicated that sales were better than the same time period last year. Almost half of contacts reported that inventory levels were up slightly compared to last month, but most were satisfied that current levels were appropriate. High-end and outlet stores were specifically identified as doing well and were posting improved profits. Most merchants polled expect overall sales to improve over the next three months. Auto dealers indicated that sales continued to be strong because of pent-up demand and are better positioned to obtain financing; the pace of sales during early November and December was reportedly the strongest in over two years.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|1|Residential brokers indicated that sales continued to soften in late November and December but remained ahead of last year's weak levels. However, sales growth varied somewhat across the region. Florida brokers reported that sales growth, measured year-over-year, rebounded in November after moderating slightly in the previous two months. These sales continued to be driven by international and cash sales. Elsewhere in the District, most brokers reported that sales were similar to weak levels seen a year ago. Many contacts noted that appraisals remained problematic. Inventories declined on a year-over-year basis. Brokers continued to report downward pressure on home prices across most of the District. Many anticipate modest sales growth over the next several months with the most positive expectations coming from Florida brokers.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|1|On balance, District manufacturing contacts showed notable improvements in both levels of new orders and production in November after reporting several months of decelerating activity. In addition, more contacts reported improving expectations for future production than in previous reports. Export manufacturers and auto producers, in particular, reported strong activity. Auto producers noted that recent flooding in Thailand would likely have a modest, negative impact on production of some models as several plants in that region were damaged or forced to curtail operations for several weeks.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|1|Liquidity levels at depository institutions remained high as many banks reported strong deposit growth coupled with continued weak loan demand. Some banking contacts noted that they cut loan prices to attract new customers and offered loan concessions proactively to retain existing clients. There was also little demand for new housing loans, although bankers reported mortgage refinancing and automobile loan activity increased. In terms of commercial lending, loan growth among community banks and credit unions was primarily limited to owner-occupied enterprises, while some larger banks reported growth in areas such as energy and healthcare.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2012|1|Contacts across most sectors continued to report modest hiring activity across much of the District. Most of the hiring has been temporary in nature and tied to seasonal employment. However, there were some scattered reports among healthcare and hospitality contacts in South Florida that hiring was occurring as a result of increased demand or expansion. Agriculture contacts reported labor shortages across Alabama, citing newly enacted immigration legislation as the culprit. Firms also noted reluctance towards adding new full-time employees because of uncertainty surrounding healthcare reform, a large pool of both over and under qualified applicants, and because productivity enhancements have made several positions redundant.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|1|Energy industry contacts indicated that they continued to add to their workforces and that plans to invest in increased production capacity were proceeding. Permitting for shallow water rigs in the Gulf of Mexico picked up slightly. The first lease auction for deepwater exploration since last year's Gulf oil spill occurred in December with 191 tracks being sold for $337.7 million.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|1|Retailers generally characterize holiday-season spending as strong and most report that sales were on or above plan. A trade association survey of retailers across New York State points to robust spending, particularly in the final week before Christmas and on the day after; most contacts indicated that sales were at least as strong as in 2010, led by electronics--particularly video games and consoles. One large retail chain reports that November-December sales were above plan and up moderately from a year earlier, while another major chain indicates that sales were down from 2010 levels but still roughly on plan. Both contacts note that unseasonably mild weather hampered sales of outerwear and other seasonal apparel. However, two major malls in upstate New York say that mild weather--along with brisk demand from Canadian shoppers--contributed to strong sales in November and early December. A number of contacts also note exceptional strength in on-line sales, with some reporting year-over-year gains in excess of 40 percent. Retail prices are reported to be generally stable.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|1|Residential rental markets continue to strengthen, while real estate sales have shown little change since the last report and new development activity continues to be sluggish. New York City's rental market remains tight: rents continue to rise, as the inventory of available units remains lean. Manhattan co-op and condo prices were little changed in the fourth quarter, while sales activity slowed from its fairly brisk third quarter pace. Market conditions were reported to be similar in Brooklyn but a bit softer in the other boroughs and on Long Island. On a more positive note, one industry expert in New Jersey sees improved fundamentals in the housing market and foresees a pickup in market conditions in 2012. Real estate contacts in other parts of the District also note some increase in optimism among developers.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|1|A major New York City employment agency reports that hiring activity has slowed somewhat since October, particularly in the financial services sector, but notes that it is difficult to gauge the underlying climate during this typically slow season. Contacts at major retail chains indicated that they hired more seasonal workers this year than last. More broadly, both manufacturers and service-sector firms continue to report that employment levels at their firms remain steady, on average, though a growing number of manufacturing contacts across New York State plan to hire more workers in the months ahead.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|1|Bankers report an increase in demand for all loan categories except consumer loans, where demand held steady. The increase was most prevalent for commercial mortgages where four times as many bankers reported rising than falling demand. Respondents also indicate widespread increases in demand for refinancing. Bankers' responses suggest some tightening of credit standards for commercial and industrial loans, but no change for the other loan categories. No banker reported an easing of standards in any category. Respondents note a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories. Bankers also indicate widespread decreases in the average deposit rate. Delinquency rates are reported to have decreased for all loan categories. The improvement was most prevalent in commercial and industrial loans, where nearly three times as many respondents reported lower than higher delinquencies.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|1|Consumer spending continued to increase in late November and December. Compared to last year's holiday season, store traffic volumes were up significantly while nominal spending was up only moderately as consumers reportedly were making more shopping trips and aggressively bargain hunting to obtain the lowest prices. Several contacts noted an increase this year in online shopping and a greater prevalence of flexible and low-cost shipping options. Traditional holiday retail items such as electronics, sporting goods, hobby items, music, books, toys, and apparel all sold well. Contacts additionally reported more spending on luxury items this year. Auto sales increased since the last reporting period. Dealers reported that showroom traffic volumes were up, and many expected sales to continue to improve further in 2012. Importantly, contacts cited a continued boost from replacement demand in light of the record high average age of vehicles in the U.S.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|1|Business spending was steady in late November and December. Contacts reported that inventory levels were generally in-line with sales, although inventory rebuilding continued in the auto industry in the aftermath of the supply chain disruptions earlier in the year. Capital investment plans were largely unchanged, with several manufacturers moving ahead with planned increases in capacity. Hiring remained selective, but the majority of contacts indicated plans to increase employment next year. A staffing firm noted slower growth in billable hours and below-average seasonal hiring in office and clerical positions. However, they also indicated that permanent placement activity continued to increase for industrial positions. Manufacturers again cited difficulties in attracting job candidates with ideal skill sets in technical fields such as engineering. Many of these firms indicated that they would rather postpone hiring a candidate until economic conditions improve to a point that would clearly warrant them doing so.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2012|1|Construction activity was subdued in late November and early December, but there was some improvement in overall real estate conditions. Builder showroom traffic picked up slightly, although in general residential real estate market conditions remained depressed as foreclosed properties continued to put downward pressure on prices and single-family construction remained at low levels. In contrast, multi-family construction continued to be an area of strength. The number of residential leases being signed increased from the previous reporting period and rents rose. Nonresidential construction was also up moderately with the strongest gains in Class A properties. Contacts noted greater demand for both industrial and healthcare facilities. In addition, commercial real estate conditions improved slightly with commercial rents stabilizing and a decline in the available amount of sublease space.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|1|production increased in late November and December. Contacts in the manufacturing sector were more optimistic for 2012 given the pace at which their order books are filling through the first quarter. Auto production increased over the reporting period. However, some contacts still are concerned about the ability to ramp up production much further over the near-term because auto suppliers may be approaching capacity constraints. Demand for heavy equipment remained strong, led by robust activity in the energy and agriculture sectors. Exports also continued to be a source of strength, although slower growth in China and Europe was noted to have held back sales at some firms. In the steel sector, inventories at service centers remain near desired levels, and given the continued strength in the auto, energy, machinery, and mining sectors, steel production was expected to increase in the first quarter of 2012.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|1|Credit conditions were little changed during the reporting period. Corporate funding costs, while variable, were largely unchanged on balance. Liquidity remained relatively scarce in the high yield debt markets. Banking contacts indicated that business loan demand continued to be subdued, with the exception of some large multinational mining corporations. Businesses utilization of credit lines was only up a bit. Because lenders continue to see their clients' balance sheets growing stronger, they speculated that uncertainty about future business conditions was restraining the demand for credit. However, contacts also noted that some larger manufacturers are making loans to sub-tier suppliers out of retained earnings, thus reducing these suppliers' typical demand for credit from financial institutions.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|1|Cost pressures eased in late November and early December. While pressure on costs remained from commodities such as steel and food, it moderated significantly for cotton and energy goods. Pass through of elevated material costs to consumers continued. Wage pressures remained moderate, with contacts noting that annual increases in wage and non-wage benefits were largely in-line with last year's increases.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|1|Farm income for 2011 was higher than in 2010; and farmland values and cash rental rates were reported to be higher once again. After falling initially during the reporting period, corn and soybean prices rose in the last half of December. More generally, crop prices fell during the harvest period. However, most crop deliveries involved sales at pre-harvest prices, as many end users found it necessary to ensure sufficient supplies prior to the harvest. In contrast, for those who didn't pre-sell, more of their crop ended up being put into storage. Milk and hog prices fell during the reporting period, while cattle prices increased. Still, export demand helped keep prices for both dairy and meat products higher than they were at the end of 2010. Input costs have risen for the coming planting season.
dallas|Prices|2012|1|Contacts across industries said prices held steady or declined. The exceptions were producers of paper, fabricated metals and food who noted increased prices for some inputs. Crop commodity prices were generally lower than six weeks ago, while cattle prices held fairly steady.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|1|Employment levels were flat to up slightly at most responding firms. Staffing firms continued to note high levels of demand. Energy industry respondents said labor shortages for skilled workers, such as engineers, geologists, and machinists, remained a barrier to expansion. Some producers of food, fabricated metals and transportation equipment noted moderate employment increases, and auto dealers said they continue to look for additional workers. Wage pressures remained minimal, although staffing firms noted modest increases in billing rates for skilled workers. Several firms noted plans to give employees cost-of-living adjustments next year.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|1|Construction-related manufacturers' responses were mixed. Stone, clay and glass producers said demand was below expectations, while lumber producers noted no change in activity. Fabricated metals producers said demand had increased since the last report, and some reported a pickup in private nonresidential projects, especially from foreign investors. Primary metals demand was mostly stable and was characterized as "decent but not great." Construction-related firms' outlooks are cautiously optimistic for 2012.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|1|Retailers said sales activity was robust during the reporting period, and retail sales growth saw moderate gains over the comparable year-ago period. However, contacts noted consumers remain cautious and value-driven. The Eleventh District and Midwest in general exhibited stronger sales growth than other parts of the nation, according to the responding firms. Inventories have increased over the prior year, but are at desired levels. Jewelry, small electronics and apparel were areas of strength in retail this holiday season.
dallas|Services|2012|1|Staffing firms continued to report high levels of demand. However, some contacts noted a slight slowdown in activity as some clients delayed hiring until the start of 2012. Direct hires continued to drive business, with particularly strong demand for professional and technical workers. One contact noted a shortage of skilled IT professionals. Outlooks were more optimistic than in the last report, with contacts expecting demand to remain robust or improve next year. Demand for accounting services remained flat, and overall growth this year has been slightly weaker than expected. Legal firms reported steady activity, with continued strength in demand for intellectual property, energy, litigation and some real-estate services and a slight pickup in corporate activity.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|1|Housing industry contacts continue to report improving conditions overall, although sales activity remains at low levels. Home sales rose at a modest pace over the reporting period and new and existing home inventories continued to decline. Contacts are hopeful that the housing industry is poised for a recovery in 2012. Apartment demand remained steady since the last report and contacts characterize Texas markets as tight. Apartment construction continues to increase, and contacts noted that multi-family properties are the favored property type among real estate investors.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|1|Financial firms reported flat to modest increases in loan demand. National banks noted a pickup in both middle- and large-market corporate lending activity. Regional banks said loan demand was mixed, with strength in energy-related lending and weakness in other loan activity. Loan pricing remained competitive. The quality of loans outstanding continued to improve, with contacts noting a decline in problem loans. Outlooks are uncertain given mostly sluggish loan demand.
dallas|Energy|2012|1|Oil field activity slowed seasonally at year end, with the District rig count edging down. However, respondents expect a high level of activity to resume early in 2012 and increase throughout the year. Respondents cited strong orders, growing backlogs, and good pricing for their products as evidence of future growth.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|1|The District remained largely in drought, although recent rainfalls have lessened the drought's severity in most parts and benefitted the winter wheat crop. There is still very little grazing available, resulting in costly supplemental feeding of livestock. Demand for agricultural products receded slightly over the reporting period, although beef exports remained strong.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|1|Manufacturing activity has increased since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or decrease operations. Firms in the industrial gas, metallic component, automotive parts, primary metal, and clothing manufacturing industries announced plans to increase operations and hire new workers. In contrast, firms in the speaker component, medical equipment, furniture, and dye manufacturing industries announced plans to decrease operations and lay off workers.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|1|Home sales continued to decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2010, November 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 3 percent in Memphis, 4 percent in St. Louis, 5 percent in Louisville, and 7 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction also continued to decrease throughout the District. November 2011 year-to-date single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District's metropolitan areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 1 percent in Memphis, 17 percent in Louisville, and 21 percent in Little Rock and St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|1|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 0.2 percent in the three-month period from mid-September to mid-December. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.4 percent of total loans, decreased 0.5 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.5 percent of total loans, decreased 0.2 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of loans, increased 2.0 percent. All other loans, accounting for 6.4 percent of total loans, increased 8.0 percent. Over this period, total deposits increased 0.3 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|1|As of the beginning of December, the number of bales of cotton ginned (separated from the seed) in the District states was up by 11.9 percent over the same period in 2010. Monthly output of commercial red meat for October 2011 increased compared with September 2011 and October 2010. However, the District's total live weight and number of young chickens slaughtered decreased between September and October 2011. The District's monthly coal production for November 2011 was 2.7 percent lower compared with November 2010; however, the District's year-to-date coal production at the end of November 2011 was 2.8 percent higher than the same period in 2010.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|1|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported further modest increases in new orders and shipments. Gains were widespread among the makers of industrial machinery and equipment, and of food products. Similarly, a supplier to the broad industrial market confirmed continued growth but noted some softness of a seasonal nature. Some makers of lumber and wood products and of electrical machinery reported seasonal slowing. However, one electrical equipment firm logged the worst month of orders in five years. Several contacts attributed additional slowing to end-of-year inventory adjustments. Contacts in primary metals reported mixed results dependent upon their firm's market orientation, for example, to Europe or to the domestic auto industry.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|1|Third District retailers reported strong holiday sales in November and positive, but softer, sales in December. An outlet operator recounted that the typical budget-conscious, discount-driven consumer shopped early, then faded somewhat. The longer shopping season and added store hours produced greater overall sales volumes but also increased the wage bill for hourly workers. Profits for the season were maintained by closely watching inventories and markdown levels. Unseasonably warm weather dampened sales of cold-weather goods, but "rain boots sold well." Prospects beyond this holiday season are expected to follow recent trends with high-end, online, and outlet market segments attracting the most consumer spending.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|1|Overall loan volumes continued to expand slightly in the Third District since the previous Beige Book; however, many bankers reported difficulty maintaining loan volumes. Some reported turning down deposits for lack of sufficient lending opportunities. The strongest loan growth continued to emerge in home mortgages, including refinancings. Commercial real estate and C&I lending were flat. Credit quality continued to improve somewhat. Third District bankers expressed several concerns, including Europe's economic problems, a lack of recovery in the housing market, uncertainty and a lack of confidence with Washington, and uncertainty over the renewal of federal contracts.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|1|Residential builders are "glad to have 2011 behind" them. Builders reported that the year closed with sales activity slowing somewhat more than seasonal trends would predict due to lack of confidence, as existing home prices continued to fall in most markets. Some of the activity reported in the last Beige Book dissipated, as builders were unable to close on contracts. New construction activity continues to shift from the single-family market toward the multifamily market. Some builders are planning for growth in 2012, even some hiring. However, their plans assume an increase in market share and an expectation that some competitors will not endure a seventh consecutive year with little or no growth.
philadelphia|Services|2012|1|Third District service-sector firms have continued to report modest growth since the last Beige Book. A staffing firm noted that firms appear busier, based upon an end-of-year uptick in short-term contracts to provide coverage for vacations and extra holiday business--a pattern not observed since the recession began. The overall trend toward temporary or contract basis for new placements, rather than permanent, full-time hires, remains unchanged. Contacts indicated that financial services will face challenges in 2012, and many sources expressed concern for defense-related activity in the wake of recent and ongoing federal budget indecisions. The majority of service-sector firms anticipate slowly improving growth rates through 2012.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|1|On balance, price levels have changed little since the previous Beige Book. Auto dealers and freight shippers still command favorable pricing power. Several manufacturing firms recently raised prices and have yet to observe any pushback from their customers. Retailers and homebuilders continue to report very tight margins. Builders are worried about ongoing closures along their supply chain as the recession in construction continues. Substantial cost increases are anticipated when a recovery emerges and triggers demand for more building materials. Although exceptions exist within specific submarkets, concessions are still expected of many bankers, builders, and leasing agents. Most firms reported no significant upward wage pressure. While most firms are anticipating greater increases in health benefit costs, a few have indicated a significant rollback from last year's large rate hike.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|1|Reports on consumer spending were favorable in general. Most Districts reported that holiday retail sales were up noticeably over last year's season, with New York and Dallas describing sales as "brisk" and "robust," respectively. Consumer spending and confidence generally were characterized as firmer than in recent reporting periods, although Kansas City reported that spending softened. Items identified as the strongest holiday sellers by various Districts included consumer electronics and jewelry, and Chicago noted that luxury items in general sold well during the holiday season. By contrast, many Districts reported weak sales and excess inventories of warm clothing, due to unusually mild weather. Retail inventories more broadly were reported to be at or near desired levels, consistent with retailers' sales expectations. Boston, New York, and Minneapolis noted exceptional growth in Internet sales for selected items. Sales of new automobiles continued to pick up in most Districts. Among the more favorable reports, Atlanta noted that the pace of auto sales in November and December was "the strongest in over two years," and strong demand and sales were reported as well by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2012|1|Demand generally strengthened further for nonfinancial services. Providers of professional and business services such as consulting, advertising, engineering, and legal services expanded their activities according to Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Sales of technology services to businesses and consumers grew further, according to Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, although the pace of growth slowed from earlier in 2011. Providers of temporary staffing services saw strong and rising demand in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts but below-average seasonal hiring in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Reports from the health-care sector generally pointed to growth as well, with Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis highlighting construction activity and bank lending aimed at health-care providers. The exception to growing demand for health-care services was San Francisco, which reported an ongoing decline in hospital admissions. Demand for shipping and transportation services generally expanded. New York and Atlanta reported a significant increase in shipping tonnage by truck, and Dallas noted a broad-based increase in shipments by rail. Atlanta reported that port activity was up over twelve months earlier due to "notable strength in exports," while Richmond reported a decline in port activity that was largely attributed to reduced imports. Air travel was above year-ago levels in the Atlanta District but unchanged over the past six weeks in the Dallas District.
summary|Manufacturing|2012|1|activity expanded in most Districts, generally continuing its steady overall expansion or, in the case of Atlanta, reversing a slowdown in prior periods. For the sector as a whole, further growth or improved conditions were reported by almost all Districts, except for Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, which reported that activity was largely stable or mixed, and Kansas City, which noted a slight decline. The strongest reports came from subsectors such as heavy equipment manufacturing and steel, for which demand has been boosted by robust growth in the energy, agricultural, and auto manufacturing sectors. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis confirmed vibrant activity for auto manufacturers, primarily for domestic makes. By contrast, demand remained somewhat weak for firms in housing-related subsectors, such as a door manufacturer in the Richmond District, furniture manufacturers there and in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts, and makers of lumber and wood products in the San Francisco District. Demand for computers and related electronic components rose further, according to Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, the pace of growth has slowed significantly from earlier in 2011, and Boston noted declining sales of semiconductors, mainly due to weaker demand from Asia. According to Dallas and San Francisco, aircraft makers saw further demand increases. Those Districts also noted weak domestic demand for refined petroleum products that was largely or completely offset by robust foreign demand. Demand grew smartly for food producers in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, but in the Kansas City District food processing was one of the weakest performers within the manufacturing sector. Export sales of assorted manufactured products generally performed well according to Atlanta and Chicago, although slower economic growth in China and Europe held back sales for some manufacturers.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|1|Activity in residential real estate markets largely held steady at very low levels, with the exception of further increases in the construction of multifamily residences. The pace of single-family home sales remained quite sluggish throughout the country, although the Dallas District reported a modest increase over the prior reporting period. Some Districts, such as Boston and Atlanta, noted that home sales exceeded levels from twelve months earlier, but mainly because the earlier levels reflected a substantial drop following the expiration of the homebuyers' tax credit in mid-2010. Prices were largely stable on a short-term basis in most areas but in many instances were below their levels from twelve months earlier. Extensive inventories of distressed properties were reported to be a source of price restraint in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Construction of single-family homes remained at depressed levels in most areas and fell further in some, such as the Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. However, Cleveland reported that activity improved during the past couple of months. In contrast to the soft market for single-family residences, the market for rental units tightened in some areas such as the New York and Richmond Districts, and construction of multifamily residences rose in the Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.
summary|Banking and Finance|2012|1|Lending activity edged up overall, primarily due to increased loan demand by businesses. Most Districts that commented on lending activity indicated little or no change in overall loan demand, but the remaining Districts identified increases rather than decreases. New York reported a pronounced increase in demand for commercial mortgages, and Cleveland also noted increased demand in this category. Both Dallas and San Francisco noted a slight uptick in commercial and industrial lending. Consumer lending was largely flat compared with the prior reporting period, although auto loans rose in Cleveland. New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported demand growth or continued strength for refinancing of residential mortgages.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|1|Demand for agricultural products was strong during the reporting period, but growing conditions and input prices were mixed. Farm income and profits were reported to be at very high levels by Chicago and Kansas City, enabling many farmers to repay loans and expand their operations, and San Francisco reported further sales growth for a variety of agricultural products. Rising foreign demand was noted as a source of strength for livestock sales in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts and for dairy and meat products in the Chicago District. Growing conditions were somewhat mixed across areas. Farmers and livestock producers in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts have been struggling with ongoing droughts, which have required costly responses such as supplemental feeding of livestock. While timely rains eased drought conditions somewhat in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts, wheat farmers in the latter are hoping for more protective snow cover for the winter crop's dormancy period. In addition, high or rising prices for some inputs were noted by Chicago and Kansas City, tempering farmers' profit expectations for the coming year.
summary|Prices and Wages|2012|1|Upward price pressures and price increases were very limited during the reporting period. Reports from various Districts, including Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago, indicated that upward price pressures from rising commodity and input prices have eased substantially, with Boston noting that "even food prices have ceased rising." Atlanta reported that firms have limited pricing power in general, and San Francisco pointed to intense supplier competition as a factor holding down prices. Similarly, Kansas City reported a recent uptick in input prices but noted that few manufacturers passed these increases on to the prices of their finished goods.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|1|District manufacturing activity remained flat since our last report. Our latest survey showed little change in shipments, but a slight increase in new orders. A producer of residential doors reported that business at his firm remained depressed. Similarly, a furniture manufacturer said that demand was generally sluggish across all categories, particularly for residential furniture. In contrast, a fabricated metal producer cited an improvement in December's order volume, which he attributed to customers placing orders in advance of higher basic metals prices. That increase in orders allowed his company to operate at capacity and avoid employee layoffs. Moreover, an automobile parts manufacturer ordered new manufacturing equipment due to increased demand and the need to reduce employee overtime. According to our survey respondents, both raw materials prices and finished goods prices grew at a notably slower pace than a month ago.
richmond|Retail|2012|1|merchants gave mixed sales reports, while wholesalers generally indicated a pickup. The manager of a chain discount store in North Carolina described sales as "erratic," and a contact in the Tidewater area noted that sales were unchanged, even with increased foot traffic. Unusually warm weather in the District depressed sales of winter apparel. Toys and electronics, particularly televisions, moved briskly in recent weeks. A retailer told us that customers have returned as much as a third of the items previously placed on lay-away before finishing the payments, because, customers said, they "need the money." Although big-ticket sales were down slightly, there were reports of improvement. Jewelers generally reported robust sales. Although higher prices for gold and precious gems damped sales at some stores, other items such as silver remained in demand. Rising cotton prices continued to push up apparel prices. According to several car dealers, strong used-vehicle demand increased trade-in equity. Low interest rates and the rising average age of vehicles on the road also helped move new cars. On the whole, retail price increases were smaller since our last report.
richmond|Services|2012|1|Revenues at non-retail services firms accelerated in recent weeks. Hospital and other healthcare contacts noted that mergers have increased among smaller hospitals and physician practices, as changes in healthcare roll out. Nursing home executives also expressed concern about reduced Medicare payments and the inability of potential resident-care patients to sell their homes. Revenues rose more quickly at medical records management firms, temp staffing agencies, and telecommunications firms. In addition, a pickup in business at engineering firms was noted in recent weeks. An engineering contact in West Virginia commented that old projects that "have been on the shelf" were proceeding. Prices at services firms increased at a somewhat faster pace since our last report.
richmond|Finance|2012|1|Loan demand in the District continued to be generally weak. A West Virginia banker reported that local lending was weak, with no increase for some time. A South Carolina banker cited a decline in the number of outstanding loans. Also, several bank officials around the District noted that, except for multi-family building and refinancing, real estate lending continued to be quite soft. Several bank officials attributed weak loan demand to a lack of confidence on the part of businesses. However, a number of commercial developers noted greater difficulty getting their loans approved. In contrast, an analyst for a large bank in the District reported that commercial lending improved slightly over the last few months, led by small business needs for new capital equipment. A lending officer in Richmond also noted improvement in consumer borrowing for autos, home improvement, and debt consolidation. And several small commercial bankers around the District stated that they were picking up loans from customers who were dissatisfied with the service they were getting from large banks. Most bank contacts stated that interest rates were little changed, and the quality of loans continued to improve modestly.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|1|Residential real estate activity softened since our last report, although a few pockets of strength remained. Several Realtors reported that sales fell considerably and housing prices had declined from a month ago. Many agents attributed the drop in sales prices to short/distressed sales being used as comparables. Most Realtors cited sales in the low-price range as faring better than sales in the high-price range. An exception, however, was an agent in the D.C. area who said that sales in the $1,500,000 plus range were up 31 percent. Brokers in Richmond and Charlotte noted that the rental market was heating up. A builder in Charleston, South Carolina described residential construction as very weak, with a rise in the average number of days on the market for new homes, even as the number of homes for sale declined. In central Virginia, a real estate agent indicated most shoppers were serious about buying, although foot traffic had slowed down quite a bit in recent months. He added that, while closed sales were down, pending sales were up from a year ago.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|1|Assessments of labor market activity changed little since our last report. A representative at a Charlotte staffing and recruiting company for accounting and finance reported an increase in corporate hiring. A staffing services contact from Charleston, South Carolina indicated that 2011 has been an exceptionally strong year for temporary placements, but noted the pool of sufficiently qualified candidates was relatively small and many applicants were disqualified by drug tests. Several contacts cited examples of workers who had declined employment opportunities in favor of unemployment benefits. Looking ahead, employment agencies expected stronger demand for temporary workers during the next six months, along with improving economic activity. A Maryland contact said that he expected employers to utilize temp help to a greater extent than last year, because of economic uncertainty. A commercial architect in Charlotte also reported a trend toward the use of contract labor instead of hiring full time employees. A source from a management consulting group in Maryland stated that businesses believe that regulation and tax increases are impeding full-time hiring. According to our latest survey, hiring at non-retail service firms picked up briskly in December and average wages strengthened. In contrast, retailers cut jobs and average retail wages flattened. Manufacturing employment edged lower over the last month, while the average workweek held steady; wages increased on pace with a month ago.
richmond|Tourism|2012|1|A majority of hotel and resort contacts indicated bookings have been solid since our last report. The manager of a western Virginia hotel and resort described a very busy Thanksgiving weekend. He remarked that they were booked full through the Christmas weekend, even though the unseasonably warm weather limited the number of open ski slopes. A contact on the North Carolina Outer Banks cited good autumn and early winter tourist activity, and added that bookings were equal to or better than a year ago. Owners of vacation rental property there expected a surge in reservations by early January, when people typically act on decisions made during the winter holidays. A hotel manager in central Virginia also reported increased bookings, and a contact at a North Carolina amusement and recreation venue noted a pick-up in revenues. In contrast, a hotelier in the Piedmont region of South Carolina indicated bookings have been flat. In addition, hotel contacts on the Virginia coast reported that bookings have not increased as expected, owing to the difficult economy and cuts in federal government spending on travel. One hotel representative noted that government employees are now sharing rooms rather than booking individually. Rates were generally unchanged.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|1|Consumer spending softened in late November and December, with a slowdown in the auto, restaurant, and tourism sectors. Many District contacts attributed the weakness in spending to ongoing regulatory and political uncertainty. Most retailers, however, expected spending to rise over the next three months. Following several months of strong activity, auto dealers reported a dip in sales with slower sales expected in coming months. Auto inventories increased over the previous survey period, and most dealers reported satisfaction with current levels. Restaurant sales were flat despite larger average check amounts. However, restaurant contacts expected sales to rebound over the next three months. Tourism activity slowed, as winter storms hampered some tourist activity but helped ski resorts. Hoteliers reported lower occupancy rates but stable average room rates.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|1|Manufacturing activity contracted slightly during the survey period, but factory operators remained optimistic about the coming months. Activity was broadly weaker, with production, shipments, and new orders lower relative to the prior survey. The weakest sectors were food processing and fabricated metals, while growth in machinery and high-tech manufacturing remained strong. Order backlogs, manufacturing employment, and average hours worked declined. Despite weaker activity, expectations were positive for the coming months for production, shipments, and orders. Transportation firms reported mostly unchanged conditions as activity remained well above year-ago levels. Most high-tech services firms reported sales gains and increased capital spending. Contacts in both the transportation and high-tech sectors reported continued difficulty finding skilled workers.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|1|Residential and commercial real estate activity remained sluggish in late November and December. District home prices were flat, but most real estate contacts expected prices to rise along with home sales over the next three months. Multiple contacts reported multi-family housing as a source of strength in the housing market. Mortgage lenders reported weak mortgage demand with fewer home purchases and refinancings relative to the previous survey period. Lenders cited stricter mortgage lending requirements as a key factor underlying weak loan demand. Housing starts declined further, and expectations about future construction activity remained subdued. Construction supply firms reported weak sales over the survey period, and most expected little change in activity over the coming months. Commercial real estate sales, prices, and vacancy rates improved, and District contacts were more optimistic about the coming months. Rents on commercial properties were stable and expected to rise over the next three months. Developers reported little change in access to credit.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|1|Almost all bankers reported generally steady loan demand, stable or improving loan quality, and increased deposits. Loan demand by category was mixed. Most respondents reported steady loan demand for commercial and industrial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, and consumer installment loans. Remaining respondents were split between stronger and weaker demand within each of these categories. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories and deposits increased for the eighth straight survey. Bankers generally reported loan quality as steady or improving compared to a year ago and reported the outlook for loan quality over the next six months as steady or improving.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|1|Agricultural growing conditions improved in late November and December but farm income prospects dimmed with high input costs. Timely rains eased drought conditions in the Southern Plains. Most of the winter wheat crop emerged in good condition, though more protective snow cover was needed for the winter dormancy period. Volatile crop prices and high input costs tempered crop profit expectations for the coming year. High production costs trimmed margins for livestock operators even though strong export demand underpinned prices. Still, with historically high profits, many farmers were repaying operating loans, buying farmland and purchasing additional machinery and equipment. District contacts reported an increase in the number of farmland auctions as record high land prices enticed more landowners to sell.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|1|District energy and mining contacts reported continued strong activity in late November and December and remained optimistic about the coming months. Drilling rig counts were flat in most District states but remained well above year-ago levels. Drilling continued to shift away from dry natural gas and toward liquid-rich formations. However, crude exploration in the Niobrara formation in Wyoming slowed as contacts reported better opportunities in other areas. Producers expected stable crude prices but relatively weak natural gas prices over the next three months. Attracting qualified workers and finding adequate equipment remained a concern for oil and gas contacts. District coal production declined slightly in November and December and remained below year-ago levels. A recent drop in ethanol prices trimmed margins for ethanol producers despite lower input costs and strong export demand.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|1|District contacts reported higher prices for both inputs and finished goods, but wage pressures remained confined to select industries and occupations. Manufacturers reported an uptick in input prices in late November and December, but relatively few reported higher finished goods prices. Manufacturers expected further price increases for both inputs and finished goods in the coming months. Most restaurants reported a continued rise in food costs and expected further increases over the next three months. Retailers and transportation firms increased prices in the latest survey period, while construction suppliers reported falling prices due to weak building demand. Few contacts outside of the energy, high-tech, and transportation sectors reported either hiring shortages or upward wage pressures, and most expected little wage pressure in the coming months. Rising employee benefit costs, particularly for health care, remained a concern for many contacts.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|11|Upward price pressures were very limited on balance during the reporting period. Prices fell for some energy items, mainly crude oil and retail gasoline; prices rose significantly for natural gas but remained very low by historical standards. Earlier price increases for food commodities prompted moderate price increases by restaurants, in the range of 2 to 3 percent. Price movements for raw materials used in the agricultural, industrial, and construction sectors were uneven but appeared to be slightly upward on balance. Retail prices were characterized as largely flat.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|11|Retail sales expanded further. A pickup was noted for department store sales during the reporting period, on the heels of a slight slowdown earlier. Significant sales gains were reported for consumer technology products such as tablet computers and games, and retailers added to inventories of these products in anticipation of solid sales growth during the upcoming holiday season. Sales of new and used automobiles remained strong, running well above levels from 12 months earlier, with further gains expected at year-end.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|11|District manufacturing activity was mixed across sectors but appeared to expand on balance during the reporting period of October through mid-November. Production activity for commercial aircraft and parts has been running well above levels from last year, with further gains in production and sales expected over the next few years. Demand continued to grow at a modest pace for pharmaceutical manufacturers. For producers of wood products, capacity utilization and sales have held up in recent months and generally have been running above their levels from last year. By contrast, the slowdown continued for makers of information technology equipment, with further sales declines reported for some equipment categories. Demand for scrap metal and steel remained low by historical standards but improved a bit, largely as a result of increased demand for use in automobile manufacturing and infrastructure construction projects. Production activity fell at petroleum refineries in response to recent declines in consumer demand for gasoline.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|11|Agricultural producers saw further sales gains, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production continued to expand. Contacts noted that the agricultural sector appears to be immune from factors that have restrained growth in other sectors of late: production activity and sales of most crop and livestock products have been growing at a solid pace, as has investment spending on new production equipment. Extraction activity expanded on balance for petroleum and natural gas, although the number of rigs used for natural gas extraction has been falling as producers have shifted their extraction activities toward higher-valued oil formations.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|11|Home demand in the District continued to strengthen, while demand for commercial real estate was largely stable. Home sales have been growing on a sustained basis in most areas, spurring incremental gains in home construction activity. Home prices also have firmed, with significant gains reported over the past 12 months in some areas, substantially reducing foreclosure pressures. Construction activity for multifamily rental projects grew further in response to rising rents and tight availability of lower-priced homes. Demand for nonresidential space was largely stable overall, and contacts noted that the amount of new commercial construction was limited, although significant construction activity continued for large infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|11|District banking contacts reported that loan demand was largely unchanged on balance. Business loan demand was characterized as weak to moderate. Firms in most sectors remain uncertain about near-term prospects for their revenues and costs; hence, they are reluctant to make new capital investments other than those that directly enhance business efficiency and pay returns within a short time frame. The reports continued to highlight ample liquidity and stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to well-qualified business loan applicants, with community banks facing increasing competition from larger national banks for small business lending. Consumer lending expanded further, primarily for automobile purchases and new or refinanced home mortgages. Contacts noted that credit quality has been showing slow but steady improvement for business and consumer loans.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2012|11|First District retailers contacted for this round report that year-over-year October sales changes ranged from single-digit decreases to single-digit increases. A durable goods retailer reported a large single-digit decrease which they attributed to a decline in customer traffic related to preparations for and the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Sales of adult apparel and home furnishings continue to be strong. Some retailers have increased their hiring in anticipation of the holiday season.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|11|Manufacturing respondents give a general picture of weak growth. Of the 10 firms contacted this cycle, all but one report growth versus the period a year earlier but only four report higher year-on-year growth versus the previous quarter. Similarly mixed numbers appear across other measures, with three firms reporting an improved outlook, four reporting higher employment and four reporting higher capital expenditures.
boston|Software and Information Technology Services|2012|11|New England software and information technology services contacts generally report weaker-than-expected activity through October, with revenues in the third quarter roughly on par with year-earlier levels. The downtick in activity reportedly reflects heightened political and economic uncertainty, which has rendered many potential clients unwilling to commit to projects. Many contacts report increasing difficulty in executing large license agreements, particularly in Europe, where one contact says sluggishness in the manufacturing sector led to a year-over-year decline in license revenue of nearly 40 percent. Delays in contract signings and project starts have led many respondent firms to slow the pace at which they are hiring; one contact may reduce headcount modestly in coming months, after hiring "in advance of anticipated need" earlier this year. Capital and technology spending and selling prices have gone largely unchanged since February.
boston|Staffing Services|2012|11|New England staffing firms generally report improved business conditions, with most describing business since Labor Day as "pretty good." Year-over-year revenue changes in the third quarter varied widely, from down slightly to up by about 20 percent. Labor demand is up slightly in the IT and engineering sectors, and one contact reports renewed activity in the manufacturing sector. However, demand for office and clerical assistants and accountants remains weak. In terms of labor supply, candidates with high-end skill sets such as nurses, mechanical and electric engineers, and software developers remain hard to find. In addition, one contact reports that turnover has recently decreased, as those with jobs are hunkering down for the holiday season. Nevertheless, bill rates and pay rates have gone largely unchanged since August. The outlook among New England staffing contacts is generally consistent with that of three months ago, with most expecting more robust growth in 2013.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|11|According to contacts across the First District, commercial real estate fundamentals were roughly flat in recent weeks amid light leasing activity. In Hartford, downtown office vacancy rates (as percentages) remain in the mid-20s, although absorption could improve in the coming months if pending lease deals go through. A Providence contact also sees some chance of significant absorption in the downtown office market but noted downside risks linked to macroeconomic conditions. In Portland, leasing activity in recent months remained light and fell below expectations, resulting in flat rental rates. In Boston, office fundamentals showed modest improvements in the third quarter, but leasing inquiries have reportedly fallen off recently amid concern over the fiscal cliff. Sales activity in Boston also softened, despite prior expectations that property owners would rush to take capital gains at current tax rates in light of pending 2013 rate increases. The multifamily sector remains strong in Hartford and Boston, with rents rising as much as 10 percent over the year for some properties in greater Boston. Loan terms remain highly favorable for high-quality properties and a regional lender to commercial real estate continues to experience record loan volume.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|11|Sales growth slowed in September throughout much of the First District among both the condominium and single-family home markets. In the Greater Boston area, single-family home sales actually declined, representing the first decrease in 15 consecutive months. By contrast, condominium sales in Greater Boston rose, reaching historic levels for the month of September. Slowing growth across much of the region was attributed to the dwindling number of properties in the market and damped confidence in the local economy. Most contacts note modest price appreciation. However, in Rhode Island and Connecticut, prices declined compared to a year ago, but consistent growth in sales is expected to place upward pressure on prices. First District contacts remain fearful that ongoing declines in inventory levels will hurt the selection of homes on the market and discourage buyers in the market. Some contacts say homeowners interested in selling have been reluctant to list their homes in anticipation of greater future price appreciation.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|11|Consumer spending posted moderate gains. During the past two months, a Minnesota auto dealer reported strong sales activity for new vehicles and somewhat softer sales activity for used vehicles. A Minnesota-based restaurant and bar chain reported that recent same-store sales were up over 5 percent from last year. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased over 2 percent in October compared with a year ago. However, a mall manager in the Minneapolis area noted slight decreases in traffic and sales during September and October compared with last year. In Montana, a mall manager reported that sales were down slightly during September after a generally flat summer.
minneapolis|.|2012|11|Recent travel and tourism activity was above a year ago Convention and tourism business in the Sioux Falls, SD, area was trending above last year's levels with prospects for a good 2013, according to an official A travel agency in Minnesota noted that corporate and leisure travel sales in October were above year-ago levels Travel and tourism activity in the Duluth, Minn, area was above last year, and businesses are optimistic for 2013, according to an official
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|11|Commercial construction activity increased significantly since the last report. The permitted value of new commercial construction in October increased substantially from the same period last year in Sioux Falls and nearly quadrupled in Billings, Mont. A recent survey of Minnesota building professionals conducted by a trade association noted an improvement in market conditions. Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of October residential building permits in the Sioux Falls area was up 16 percent from last year. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the value of October residential permits was up 70 percent compared with a year ago, while it tripled in Billings.
minneapolis|Services|2012|11|Activity at professional business services firms grew since the last report. The aforementioned survey of building professionals revealed that 59 percent of engineers reported improving conditions compared with 16 percent who saw declines, while 36 percent of the architect respondents reported increases and 21 percent noted declines.  A marketing consulting firm noted a large increase in demand from firms that are launching new products or services. Demand for scientific researchers increased for a large diversified manufacturing company. A logistics consulting firm noted some disruptions in rail traffic due to Hurricane Sandy.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|11|slowed slightly since the last report. An October survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity decreased for a fourth straight month in Minnesota and South Dakota, but continued to increase in North Dakota. A wood-products facility in northern Minnesota closed. More than half of manufacturing respondents to a late-October Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey reported that they had cut capital expenditures in the past six months. In contrast, an agricultural machinery producer announced a $20 million expansion to a facility in North Dakota, a Minnesota vehicle manufacturer announced a $20 million expansion and a plastic pipe producer broke ground on a new plant in South Dakota. A maker of outdoor gear is expanding its operations in Minnesota due to strong demand from the military.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2012|11|Activity in the energy and mining sectors continued at a rapid clip. Oil and gas production remained at record levels, but exploration activity since the last report was flat in North Dakota and decreased in Montana. An oil pipeline operator announced capacity expansions on a pipeline in Minnesota and is considering construction of a high-capacity line from the North Dakota oil patch to Wisconsin. Sand mining growth continued; plans for a new loading facility in Minnesota were announced, along with plans for a rail depot in North Dakota. Iron mines in northern Minnesota remained busy, but production fell slightly from recent months.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|11|District crop producers remained in mostly good shape, despite this year's drought. Farm incomes were bolstered by high crop prices, and farmers were looking at record harvests in areas less affected by drought. However, livestock and dairy producers continued to suffer from higher input costs. Reports of ranchers culling herds due to low hay production and increased feed prices continued to surface. After years of delays, a South Dakota beef slaughter and processing plant began operations in October. Prices received by farmers for wheat, corn, soybeans, beef, dairy products and chicken increased in October from a year earlier; hog, dry bean, turkey and egg prices decreased.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|11|While labor markets continued to show signs of tightening in several areas, some layoff notices were reported. According to the aforementioned survey of building professionals, 31 percent expect to hire more workers during the upcoming year compared with 18 percent in last year's survey. Demand for nurses has picked up in western North Dakota. A representative of Montana State University noted that job prospects for graduates have improved. In Minnesota, a manufacturer of equipment used for transporting and storing natural gas as a liquid broke ground on an expansion that will add 80 jobs, and a paints and coatings manufacturer recently announced plans for an expansion that will create about 135 jobs. However, a dairy plant closing in Minnesota will lead to 130 job reductions by the end of the year, and an equipment manufacturer announced plans to close a plant, which will affect 100 jobs. Meanwhile, the closing of a pest control product plant in North Dakota will result in almost 150 job cuts.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|11|District factories reported that new orders and production increased on net during the past six weeks. Companies citing increases were mainly linked to the aerospace, construction machinery, medical device, motor vehicle, and oil and gas industries. Compared to prior-year levels, production activity was mixed. Several producers pointed to rising inventories but said that they are manageable. Many of our contacts are expecting a slight weakening in business activity during the next few months due to seasonal factors and uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the fiscal cliff. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume was down slightly, which they attributed in part to weaker international demand. Inventories have been reduced relative to sales. Steel producers expect market conditions to remain flat through at least the end of the year. District auto production showed a moderate decline during September on a month-over-month and year-over year basis for domestic nameplates, while their foreign counterparts increased production.
cleveland|Real Estate|2012|11|Reports from home builders indicated that the number of single-family housing starts since mid-September increased relative to earlier in the third quarter and on a year-over-year basis. Sales contracts were found mainly in higher price-point categories. Some contractors commented that shrinking inventories of existing homes have spurred new residential developments. Opportunities in constructing multifamily and special-needs housing remain strong. Nonetheless, tight lending standards are seen as restraining the effect of low interest rates for builders and home buyers. Builders are hopeful that the recent improvement in sales will continue after the winter slowdown. List prices of new homes are beginning to rise, and builders have cut back on discounting. Sales of existing homes have picked up, with a few reports of bidding wars.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|11|Most retailers reported a modest rise in sales during the past six weeks relative to the same time period a year ago. Increased volume was seen across product categories, except for home furnishings, which declined slightly. There is concern about potential tax increases in 2013 and the effect they might have on household spending, especially those in higher-income brackets. Our contacts are cautiously optimistic about the holiday shopping season. Two retailers said that they have expanded their inventories (after seasonal adjustments) in anticipation of rising sales volume. Vendor pricing has been fairly stable. Any increases were absorbed into store margins. Capital spending remains on target. A few retailers reported that they are considering increasing outlays during 2013, particularly for improvements to their distribution systems. No permanent hiring is expected other than at new stores. The number of temporary workers being hired for the holiday season is similar to 2011.
cleveland|Banking|2012|11|Demand for business credit moved slightly higher since our last report. Many applications were for refinancing loans originated by competitors. Small business owners found that credit is available, but collateral requirements are more stringent than prior to the recession and personal guarantees are often required. In contrast, micro-businesses reported that it remains very difficult for them to obtain credit. On the consumer side, several of our contacts reported a decline in auto lending, while demand for other consumer products held steady. Activity was strong in the residential mortgage market. Although a large majority of applicants are looking to refinance, bankers noted an increase in new-purchase requests. Delinquency rates improved across consumer and commercial loan categories. Growth in core deposits was driven more by business customers. Little change in banking payrolls is expected for the remainder of this year and into 2013.
cleveland|Energy|2012|11|Conventional oil and natural gas production held steady during the past six weeks. Most of our contacts reported plans to increase drilling in the upcoming months, which will boost capital outlays beginning early in 2013. Wellhead prices for natural gas are up slightly, while oil declined about $5 per barrel. Shale gas activity continued at a robust pace. Coal production for the year is below 2011 levels due to lower demand from domestic utilities and offshore customers and a stricter regulatory environment. Reports of idled mines were common. However, an increase in thermal coal production is expected beginning in December for the winter heating season. As a result, one producer reported that he has rehired about 25 percent of his laid-off workers. Declining prices for metallurgical coal have leveled off, while steam coal prices were mixed. Production equipment and materials prices were flat across most categories. Wage pressures are contained.
cleveland|Freight Transportation|2012|11|Reports on freight transport indicated that volume has slowed since late in the third quarter, though part of the slowing was attributed to seasonal factors. Our contacts told us that Hurricane Sandy and weakness in European markets might be contributing to the downturn. Industries driving demand include housing, motor vehicles, and retail. Most of our contacts believe that activity will be slow through year's end, with a pick-up during the first quarter of 2013. However, rebuilding in the aftermath of Sandy could provide a year-end volume boost. Costs associated with truck maintenance held steady. One contact is experiencing pushback from customers when negotiating rate increases. Reports on capital spending were mixed. Some freight haulers said that 2012 expenditures are on track. Others reported a postponement in purchasing replacement equipment due to a sluggish economy and uncertainty about the outcome of the fiscal cliff. Hiring is mainly for replacement. Recruiting qualified personnel remains difficult, which is contributing to wage pressures.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|11|District contacts indicated demand and sales were up slightly in October compared with September. Most retailers felt that consumer confidence is improving as they head into the holiday season, which led to expectations that sales would improve over last year's results. Retailers anticipate a healthy holiday season and most shared plans to hire the same amount of seasonal staff compared with last year, although there were some contacts that anticipate hiring a bit more help over the holidays than they did in 2011. Automobile dealers continued to report strong sales growth, albeit a bit less robust than earlier in the year. Low interest rates, aging vehicles, available credit, and the popularity of new fuel-efficient models were factors cited as driving growth.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|11|District residential brokers indicated that recent existing home sales were up slightly compared with year-earlier levels. Brokers reported that current home owners accounted for the largest share of home buyers in the District, while investors and first-time home buyers both were about a quarter of the market, respectively. Reports cited that investors were more active in Florida compared with other parts of the District. Most brokers again noted declining inventories and rising home prices. The outlook for sales among brokers remained positive. Most expect sales growth to be flat to slightly positive on a year-over-year basis in the short term.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|11|Manufacturing activity in the Southeast softened in October. Contacts in the region reported that new orders, production, and employment levels decelerated. Finished inventory levels were flat. Auto and auto parts producers experienced slightly softer orders, resulting in somewhat lower output after several months of very strong demand. Other durable goods contacts experienced modest growth, especially those tied to the improving housing market. Energy-related manufacturers continued to report robust activity.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|11|Small business loan demand increased slightly in some areas, but many firms remained hesitant to borrow, citing economic and political uncertainty as a drawback. Competition for high quality borrowers remained fierce among banks. Banks experienced some residential loan growth from refinancing activity. Some contacts in the District reported an increase in demand for construction loans and noted a slight increase in lending levels compared with last year. Regulatory compliance was cited as adding an additional burden by many community bankers, which hampered their ability to originate loans. Some contacts reported underwriting standards had become more restrictive and burdensome for borrowers since the last report, in terms of both credit scores and information requests.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2012|11|Employment conditions across the District continued to improve, albeit at a modest pace, in October. Auto- and energy-related firms reported additional hiring, as did some firms tied to residential construction. On the services side, accounting, and healthcare firms were the most positive. Employment agencies reported a pickup in orders for temporary help. Along those lines, some large employers announced plans to move towards hiring more part-time versus full-time employees. Firms also reported that they continued to receive a large number of applications for most newly-posted positions, causing wages to remain flat. That said, we continued to hear reports of some higher skilled positions going unfilled because of a lack of qualified applicants.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|11|Hurricane Sandy's damage to refineries and infrastructure in the Northeast caused southeastern regional refiners to increase production and transportation of oil products to affected areas. Natural gas prices and rig counts decreased switching focus to higher priced oil commodities. Contacts noted inexpensive domestic natural gas prompted downstream manufacturers to relocate foreign operations to the United States, prioritizing locations near refining operations.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|11|Retail sales are reported to have been ahead of plan in October but exceptionally weak in early November in the New York City area, mainly due to widespread power outages, store closings and accessibility problems for both customers and workers.  With the holiday sales season coming up--and with many residents in the region needing to replace destroyed or damaged property--all the lost sales are expected to be made up in the weeks ahead. One major chain reports that it is hiring more holiday-season staff than in 2011. The pricing environment is described as stable. Auto dealers in upstate New York report some flattening out in sales in October, though used car sales reportedly remain fairly robust. There has also been some softening in business at dealers' service departments. Wholesale and retail credit conditions remain favorable.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|11|Residential real estate markets in the District were mixed but generally firm prior to the storm, and its effects on the market remain unclear at this point. Manhattan's rental market remained on a positive trajectory in October, with rents up roughly 5 percent from a year earlier and vacancy rates continuing to decrease. Sales markets in both Manhattan and the outer boroughs were fairly active in October, with prices steady and the inventory of available homes characterized as low. On the other hand, housing markets in the Buffalo area showed signs of softening in October. An expert on New Jersey's housing sector notes that conditions were improving gradually prior to Sandy and expects that post-storm rebuilding will boost multi-family construction.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|11|Manufacturers across the District indicate continued weakness in general conditions since the last report; virtually all contacts in the New York City area report some loss in business due to storm-related disruptions. Manufacturers in upstate New York, which was not significantly affected by Sandy directly, reported only scattered and indirect effects from the storm, though these contacts also report some further weakening in business conditions.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|11|Small- to medium-sized banks across the District report weaker demand for consumer and especially commercial & industrial loans but steady demand for commercial and residential mortgages. Bankers report increased demand for refinancing. Respondents do not report any change in credit standards in any loan category. Bankers indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly commercial mortgages. Respondents also indicate decreases in average deposit interest rates: nearly two in five bankers report a decrease while none reports an increase. Bankers note increased delinquency rates for consumer loans and commercial & industrial loans but no change in delinquency rates for residential or commercial mortgages.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|11|The pace of consumer spending, while still moderate, increased slightly from the previous reporting period. Furniture sales improved slightly, while sales of electronics were flat from the previous reporting period. In contrast, retail auto sales fell, in part because incentives have become more directed towards leasing. Overall, retail sales surpassed expectations, which contacts attributed to promotions and generally improving consumer confidence. Nonetheless, some retailers noted a slower sales pace in early November, and many lowered their expectations for the first half of 2013. In particular, contacts expressed concern over the impact of potential changes in federal tax policy on consumers' willingness to spend.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|11|Growth in business spending moderated further in October and early November. Inventory investment continued to slow. Retail contacts reported no transportation delays stemming from Hurricane Sandy; and inventories, although slightly elevated, were indicated to be within typical seasonal ranges. Steel service center inventories were also slightly elevated, and manufacturers reported that material lead times decreased significantly. Capital spending on equipment and structures also slowed. A number of contacts reported that given the heightened uncertainty surrounding the near-term economic outlook, they were reluctant to make capital expenditures beyond productivity enhancements. Labor market conditions improved slightly from the previous reporting period. Job growth in manufacturing slowed, but there was an increase in professional services employment. However, a number of firms noted that they have put hiring plans on hold and have delayed temp-to-perm conversion decisions until next year. Those that did report ongoing plans to hire continued to note difficulty in finding skilled workers, and many have created internal training programs as a result.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2012|11|Construction activity continued to increase at a slow, but steady pace in October and early November. Multi-family construction remained a source of strength with the continued rise in residential rents and declines in apartment vacancies. Single-family construction also increased. For the first time in several years, homebuilders reported new land development projects were underway, although these remained limited to a handful of desirable locations. Demand for nonresidential construction continued to increase at a slow pace, with contacts noting that many of their customers are waiting for the resolution of the fiscal cliff and stabilization in Europe before moving ahead on capital spending projects. Vacancy rates remained elevated for many property types, and contacts indicated that few leasing and acquisition deals are being made in the retail and office spaces. That said, contacts also noted some signs of improvement in commercial real estate conditions, pointing to moderate declines in vacancies and space available for sublease.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|11|production decelerated in October and early November. Contacts expected activity to remain subdued in the coming year, and voiced concerns about the potential impact of the fiscal cliff and weaker global demand for their products. Exports to Europe and Asia as well as many parts of South America softened, but remained stronger to North America, particularly to Mexico. Capacity utilization in the steel industry decreased, but an industry contact reported that orders were anticipated to pick up some over the next two quarters. Specialty metal manufacturers also reported weaker orders. There was continued strength in demand from the power generation industry, and the heavy equipment and auto industries also remained sources of strength. However, contacts expect demand for heavy machinery to flatten in 2013 as dealer rental fleet growth returns to more a normal pace. In contrast, improving housing demand continued to benefit manufacturers of construction materials.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|11|Credit conditions continued to gradually ease in October and early November. Credit spreads and financial market volatility remained low, and asset quality steadily improved. Banking contacts reported modest growth in small business loan demand, but also slower growth in debt restructuring and leveraged finance deals as well as lower utilization of credit lines. Contacts attributed the decrease in credit demand from middle market customers to heightened uncertainty about future tax rates on capital spending. Loan pricing and standards remained broadly unchanged, with the exception of commercial and industrial and auto lending, where credit terms and availability continued to ease. Contacts noted that community and regional banks have been particularly aggressive in pricing and covenants to compete with larger banks for a limited supply of new loan opportunities.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|11|Cost pressures were little changed in October and early November. Several contacts noted that even though steel and scrap prices were lower than they were a few months ago, both had increased in recent weeks. A contact in the steel industry noted that the recent rise in scrap prices may reflect the impact of Hurricane Sandy as well as slightly higher global demand. Construction contacts also reported an increase in prices of raw materials such as lumber. Retail food prices eased, on balance, as higher prices for meat were offset by lower prices for produce, dairy, and some other grocery items. More generally, retailers indicated that discounting and promotions for non-food items also eased some over the reporting period, but were expected to pick up again after Thanksgiving. Wage pressures remained moderate, but nonwage costs increased as many contacts again cited higher healthcare costs.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|11|The corn harvest was completed ahead of last year's pace, while the soybean harvest was proceeding more quickly than typical. Much of the District reported higher yields than had been expected during the previous reporting period, reflecting in part timely local rains, later planting, and irrigation. Nonetheless, the drought still cut the District's output of corn and soybeans substantially relative to last year. Concerns about crop quality due to the drought seemed to diminish, although there were some reports of deliveries rejected for crop diseases. Corn and soybean prices--and with them livestock feeding costs--fell further, though they remained elevated from the levels of a year ago. Milk, hog, and cattle prices edged up from the prior reporting period, which also helped the cash flow of livestock operations. Sugar beet output in Michigan was higher than a year ago, and sugar prices were higher as well. Farmland values continued to rise despite the drought. Moreover, there seemed to be more farmland available to buy, partly due to uncertainty about future tax rates.
dallas|Prices|2012|11|Most reporting firms said prices were steady, however there were a few scattered reports of higher prices. Retailers said prices had not changed much since the last report, but the drought is expected to increase food costs. Some transportation services firms noted that prices were up due to increased fuel and labor costs. Several manufacturers of construction products said that stronger demand was supporting higher prices. Some paper manufacturers noted an increase in selling prices. Grain prices declined over the reporting period and cotton prices remained weak.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|11|Employment held steady or increased at most responding firms. Accounting and legal firms reported hiring, and one staffing firm was adding to its payrolls despite a recent slowdown in demand for temporary workers. Shortages of truck drivers continued to be noted by transportation service firms and there were scattered shortages of workers at energy-related firms. Wage pressures remained subdued.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|11|Overall demand for construction-related products was mixed. Demand for stone, clay, cement, glass, and lumber held steady or improved, and outlooks were more optimistic compared with the previous report. Demand for fabricated metals products held steady over the past month, but contacts noted that overall demand has been steadily improving since the beginning of 2012. Primary metals manufacturers characterized demand as poor over the past six weeks and said that they expect continued weakness in sales through year-end.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|11|Retailers said demand was mixed over the past six weeks. Sales in the Eleventh District continued to outperform the nation, according to two national retailers. Contacts said the loss in sales resulting from Hurricane Sandy was temporary and would not impact holiday spending. Outlooks through year-end were mixed.
dallas|Services|2012|11|Staffing firms said demand "came to a sudden stop" over the past six weeks, as several clients delayed hiring until after the election. Declines were reported in orders from mid-sized manufacturing and construction firms. However, one contact noted steady demand for professional, technical, and information technology positions. Outlooks were mixed.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|11|Single-family housing activity remained strong. Both new and existing home sales activity increased over the past six weeks. Contacts noted that despite a pickup in new construction, low inventories of both existing and new homes have led to moderate price increases overall. Apartment construction remained robust, but contacts said that leasing activity slowed. Outlooks are positive through year-end.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|11|Financial institutions reported mixed loan demand. Contacts said used auto lending was weak, while first mortgages and energy-related lending increased. Loan pricing continues to be very competitive, partly due to loosening credit standards. Despite low deposit rates, deposit levels at most institutions remain high. Contacts expressed concern about new regulations for community banks.
dallas|Energy|2012|11|Respondents at energy-related service firms said activity remained steady at high levels despite a decline in the rig count that was mostly natural gas related. Although oil prices remain at healthy enough levels to support current activity, recent price declines coupled with high volatility are making some firms nervous about drilling in higher cost fields. Contacts expect activity to be flat through year-end, with improvement in 2013.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|11|The District remained largely in drought, although dry conditions eased in some areas. The crop harvest generally progressed at a good pace. Winter wheat crop conditions were much better than last year, when the drought was more severe in the District. Grain prices trended down over the reporting period but were still at relatively high levels. Cotton prices remained weak and may lead to fewer cotton acres being planted next year. Cattle prices were still higher than normal but contacts noted that high feed costs were keeping producers from expanding their operations and were creating negative margins for feedlots.
st_louis|Consumer Spending|2012|11|Contacts reported that retail sales in October and early November were up, on average, over year-earlier levels. Fifty-four percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 27 percent saw decreases and 19 percent saw no changes. Forty-eight percent of the retailers noted that sales levels met their expectations, 48 percent reported that sales were below expectations, and 4 percent reported that sales were above expectations. The sales outlook through the end of the year was mostly optimistic: 66 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while 17 percent expect sales to decrease and 17 percent expect sales to be similar to last years levels.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|11|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our previous report. Several manufacturing firms reported plans to hire new workers or expand operations, while fewer manufacturers reported plans to lay off workers or reduce operations. Firms in the plastic, poultry processing, shoe and apparel, aerospace, paper product, and beverage manufacturing industries announced plans to hire new employees or expand operations. In contrast, firms in the compressor, coal, semiconductors and related devices, auto parts, and food manufacturing industries announced plans to lay off workers or reduce operations.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|11|Home sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, September 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 15 percent in Louisville, 4 percent in Little Rock, 11 percent in Memphis, and 14 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction also increased. Compared with the same period in 2011, September 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased 40 percent in Louisville, 25 percent in Little Rock, 36 percent in Memphis, and 19 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|11|A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of large District banks found little change in overall lending activity during the third quarter of 2012. During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans remained largely unchanged, while the demand for these loans and the number of inquiries ranged from moderately decreased to moderately increased. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were unchanged, while demand remained largely unchanged. Credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans remained generally unchanged, while demand ranged from about the same to substantially stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards and demand for consumer loans remained largely unchanged, although a third of the banks reported that demand for auto loans was moderately stronger.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|11|As of early November, the rice crop in the District states was fully harvested; similarly, over 90 percent of the corn, cotton, sorghum, and soybean crops have also been harvested. Harvest completion rates were 3 to 12 percentage points higher than their 5-year averages. Planting of winter wheat across the District states was 8 percent ahead of its 5-year average, while over 90 percent of all winter wheat was rated in fair or better condition. Excluding eastern Kentucky, the Districts year-to-date coal production for the end of October was 6.4 percent higher compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile, the Districts coal production for October 2012 was 6.2 percent higher than in October 2011.
st_louis|Prices, Wages, and Employment|2012|11|Contacts indicated that price levels over the past three months have stayed the same relative to the same period last year. Similarly, non-labor costs have generally stayed the same, although the majority of manufacturing contacts noted increases in costs. The majority of contacts reported that wages per employee and benefits per employee over the past three months have stayed the same relative to last year. Employment levels over the past three months showed signs of improvement; 38 percent of contacts reported increases in employment compared with the same period last year, while about half of contacts reported that their total employment has remained the same relative to last year.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|11|Hurricane Sandy's impact on Third District manufacturers seems to have somewhat accelerated the slight overall declines in orders and shipments reported during the prior Beige Book period. The immediate economic impact from Sandy is largely negative--a combination of economic disruptions and destruction of capital. Nevertheless, makers of food products, lumber and wood products, fabricated metal products, and instruments reported further gains. Makers of primary metals, industrial machinery, and electronic equipment reported further declines. A significant global manufacturer reported that growth in the U.S. and worldwide is weak and continues to slow; this firm and another large exporter specifically reported that growth in China is slowing further.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|11|Prior to the storm's advance, Third District retailers reported a small improvement in October's year-over-year sales trends following a disappointing decrease in September sales. The storm is said to have wrecked those gains temporarily. Sales shifted to necessities then slowed overall on October's final weekend as the storm approached. In many areas throughout the District, malls closed for most of two days--which are otherwise slow days of a slow week prior to the start of the holiday shopping season. By opening while many local school districts were still closed, these retailers attracted high food sales, but general retail sales remained slow and focused on hard goods through the weekend following the storm. One drug store chain closed 790 locations during the storm's peak on October 29th; only one remained completely closed two weeks later in a nearly inaccessible stretch of the Jersey Shore. Chain stores, restaurants, and independent retailers remain closed in scattered locations from Cape May to Point Pleasant Beach. More severe property damage clustered along the narrowest strips of the barrier islands where the ocean met the bay at the height of the storm. While rebuilding raised sales expectations for home repair supplies, the storm tarnished expectations for the atypically long holiday sales season, as households are preoccupied with recovery efforts.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|11|Third District financial firms have reported continued growth with a slight overall improvement since the prior Beige Book. This growth has occurred despite contacts reporting that many customers have been in a "wait-and-see mode" regarding capital investment decisions with respect to the nation's upcoming fiscal decisions. Power outages associated with Hurricane Sandy created widespread bank and ATM closings, but few long-term disruptions or significant losses. While credit quality continued to improve, contacts suggest that the storm impacts may create a surge in cash flow borrowing and an increase in delinquencies, especially for New Jersey businesses and homeowners. Lenders maintain a positive outlook.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|11|October began as a disappointing month for some residential builders, punctuated by Hurricane Sandy, which closed their offices and reduced their traffic. Brokers continued to report significantly stronger sales activity (from previously low levels) and expect to conclude their strongest year of the recovery despite the storm impacts. Inventory levels of real estate listings are significantly lower than one year ago. Jersey Shore real estate has been thrown into turmoil by an excess of displaced residents, in addition to utility, construction, and FEMA workers competing for all available rental units as temporary housing. Construction activity has already begun on the easy repairs, but it is likely to take years to repair or replace the thousands of homes damaged and demolished. Overall, builders and brokers remain cautiously optimistic.
philadelphia|Services|2012|11|The growth of Third District service-sector firms has succumbed to the perils of Hurricane Sandy and has slowed, if not declined, since the last Beige Book. Tourist areas on the Delaware and New Jersey coasts suffered a severe blow; most of the Delaware shore and parts of the South Jersey shore saw limited damage and are largely open for business. However, many areas were awash--houses demolished and businesses and their infrastructure and/or inventories ruined. Revenue reports suggest that Atlantic City casinos alone may have lost about $35 million by the end of October, despite suffering little damage. Contacts suggest the casinos have been losing another $5 million a day since. The storm also caused the cancellation of the city's largest regular, annual convention and the delay (at best) of several others. Some of the barrier island homes well north of Atlantic City are now inaccessible--cut off by new channels carved by the storm from the bay to the sea. Most of the Jersey Shore will likely be rebuilt and ready for the summer season; however, some year-round businesses will not survive this off off-season; others may never rebuild.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|11|Price levels have continued to show little overall change since the previous Beige Book. Cost factors have risen somewhat among manufacturing firms as have prices received. Homebuilders and retailers indicated that modest cost pressures continue and that strong competition restrains the prices that they can charge. Builders and contractors were beginning to grow concerned about labor shortages and rising wages, as general activity increased; Hurricane Sandy has escalated their concerns in New Jersey, as rebuilding begins to draw labor to storm-damaged areas. With few exceptions, most low-end home markets have stable or slightly rising prices, while most high-end home markets are still trending lower. One contact speculated that prices will probably fall further in storm-damaged areas along the Jersey Shore. Commercial real estate contacts expressed little change in leasing trends. Similarly, wage pressures remain minimal for most positions; medical benefits continue to trend higher.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|11|Consumer spending increased at a moderate pace in most Districts in recent weeks, with mixed reports from Dallas. In New York, sales were ahead of plan prior to Hurricane Sandy, and merchants expect to recoup sales lost during the storm as residents replace destroyed or damaged property. Philadelphia contacts reported slower growth since the last report. Apparel sales picked up in Boston, and Richmond indicated that home and garden stores reported stronger sales ahead of Hurricane Sandy. Durable goods sales varied across Districts. For example, Boston and Chicago noted an improvement in furniture, while sales in that category declined in Cleveland. Chicago reported flattening in electronics sales, whereas San Francisco contacts reported significant sales gains for consumer technology products.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2012|11|Reports from nonfinancial services providers differed among Districts. Boston reports were generally weaker than expected for tech services, while New York businesses indicated that the effects of Hurricane Sandy had negatively impacted both workers and customers. In the New York District, prolonged power and communications outages and extreme flooding hurt firms and residents, particularly on Long Island and in northern New Jersey. Slowing demand for nonfinancial services in the Philadelphia District was further hampered by the hurricane. St. Louis reported a net decline, but with expansion in some categories such as business support, telecommunications, casinos, legal, and crisis management services. Dallas noted steady demand overall, and contacts reported robust demand for insurance, audit, and legal services. However, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported net expansion, with examples of growth at engineering, technology, and architectural firms. A number of contacts across Districts expressed uncertainty about business conditions for the months ahead as the firms and their customers waited for the outcome of federal budget negotiations.
summary|Manufacturing|2012|11|Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed, though on balance, most Districts reported that conditions had weakened since the previous report. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported that activity had either slowed or declined somewhat, with most reports leaning toward the latter. Activity was mixed in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, while reports from the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts were positive. The Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted slower growth for information technology equipment, while business activity expanded at high-tech firms in the Kansas City District. Car and auto parts producers in the Atlanta District said that orders softened slightly. Similarly, auto production in the Cleveland District declined somewhat for domestic nameplates but increased for foreign nameplates. In contrast, heavy equipment and auto industries remained sources of strength in the Chicago and the Kansas City Districts. Demand was flat to down for transportation equipment in the Dallas District, and the Philadelphia District indicated that makers of primary metals, industrial machinery, and electronic equipment reported further declines.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|11|Overall, markets for single-family homes continued to improve across most Districts with the exception of Boston and Philadelphia. Residential real estate markets in the New York District were mixed but generally firm prior to the storm. Selling prices were steady or rising. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas noted declining or tight inventories. The Cleveland District indicated that the number of single-family housing starts had increased since our last report and from a year ago; most sales contracts were in higher price-point categories. Similarly, Richmond noted more residential work in the high-end home category for the first time in three years, and builders cited significant pent-up demand in the first-time buyer segment. Atlanta indicated that existing home sales were up slightly compared to a year ago and reported that investors were more active in Florida than in the rest of the District. In Chicago, residential construction increased at a slow but steady pace in October and early November, and construction increased for single-family as well as multi-family homes. St. Louis reported that residential real estate market conditions continued to improve, and Minneapolis indicated that segments of construction and real estate were growing at a double-digit clip. Kansas City characterized residential real estate activity as brisk and noted that a solid rise in home sales had reduced home inventories. Dallas noted that single-family housing activity remained strong, with both new and existing home sales activity increasing. San Francisco reported that home demand continued to strengthen and that home sales continued to grow on a sustained basis in most areas, spurring new home construction. However, sales growth generally slowed for both the condominium and single-family home markets in the Boston District, and the Philadelphia District noted that October began as a disappointing month for some Realtors, only to be punctuated by Hurricane Sandy.
summary|Banking and Financial Services|2012|11|Loan demand generally was either mixed or slightly stronger across most Districts in recent weeks. Among those noting mixed results, New York reported that demand for consumer and especially commercial and industrial loans weakened, but commercial and residential mortgage demand was steady. Richmond said that a small commercial banker was encountering a slight improvement in overall loan demand but added that consumer loans were unchanged from "meager" levels and small business loans were virtually non-existent. Chicago noted that small business loan demand experienced modest growth, but a decrease in credit demand occurred among middle-market customers. According to St. Louis contacts, overall lending activity was essentially unchanged over the period. St. Louis added that, while credit standards for commercial and industrial loans were largely unchanged, both the demand for these loans and the number of inquiries ranged from moderately lower to moderately higher. Used car loan demand was weak in the Dallas District, although first mortgage and energy-related lending increased. San Francisco cited weak-to-moderate business loan demand, but consumer lending expanded further with the help of auto loans and home mortgage refinancing; however, San Francisco noted that lending activity as a whole was unchanged. Most remaining Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City reported moderate increases in total loan demand. In the Philadelphia District, banks reported widespread bank and ATM closings due to Hurricane Sandy.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|11|Assessments of agricultural activity were mixed. Varying degrees of drought conditions persisted in several Districts, while Hurricane Sandy's agricultural damage was minimal and localized mainly in coastal areas. In the Atlanta District, much of Georgia experienced drought conditions, while Chicago reported that corn and soybean production in their District did not suffer as much from the drought as previously expected. Correspondingly, Minneapolis indicated that their District crop producers remained in mostly good shape, despite this year's drought. Low soil-moisture levels in the Kansas City District hindered winter wheat emergence, raising concerns that persistent drought could strain U.S. crop production, keep crop and feed prices high, and force further livestock herd liquidations. However, Richmond stated that most farmers in Virginia were relieved that Hurricane Sandy brought much needed rain without significant damage to the corn and soybeans still in the fields. San Francisco noted that production activity and sales of most crop and livestock products have been growing at a solid pace, as had investment spending on new production equipment. Moreover, the St. Louis District reported that harvest completion rates were considerably higher than the five-year average there.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|11|Modest improvements in hiring activity were reported by most Districts. Labor markets were generally described as improving modestly by Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Staffing firms, according to Boston and Cleveland, experienced improved business conditions. However, Richmond reported that labor markets in general were weaker than in the last report, citing examples of soft demand and an unwillingness of some manufacturers to hire long-term unemployed workers. Contacts for Boston noted that demand for office and clerical assistants and accountants remained weak, and Cleveland reported that hiring across industries was generally sluggish except in autos. Atlanta indicated that employment agencies were seeing a pickup in orders for temporary help. Some large employers, however, announced plans to move toward hiring more part-time, rather than full-time, employees. Chicago reported that a number of firms were putting hiring on hold and had delayed temp-to-perm conversion decisions until next year. With respect to the upcoming holiday season, Cleveland reported that retailers were planning to hire the same number of temporary workers as last year, while Boston and Atlanta noted that some retailers were expecting to hire more help over the holidays. Finally, contacts in a number of Districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers in some specialized occupations.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|11|District manufacturing activity continued to improve modestly. A manufacturer of dental products reported an increase in orders and commented that his company would finish the year slightly ahead of 2011. A manufacturer of organizational products said that he expected shipments to remain high; he remarked that his company was picking up market share through consolidation in the industry. A producer of plastic components noted a pickup in activity after several months of reduced orders. In addition, an aerospace manufacturer reported that the company is expanding and is completing a new manufacturing facility. According to our latest survey, both raw materials and finished goods prices rose at a slower pace since our last report.
richmond|Retail|2012|11|contacts reported a moderate acceleration in sales during late October and early November. Hardware and home and garden stores noted higher demand for storm-related items ahead of Hurricane Sandy. Quipped one executive, "Bad weather is good for business." A store manager at a department store reported that his sales were stable, although he is competing with his suppliers for online sales. Car and light truck dealers gave mixed reports. Dealers in Maryland and West Virginia saw a drop in sales, however a West Virginia dealer recently completed expansion at his location to accommodate additional inventory for ongoing strong sales, and a North Carolina dealer commented that year-over-year sales were mostly strong across the board. The pace of retail price increases slowed since our last report.
richmond|Services|2012|11|Executives at services firms generally reported a modest rise in customer demand since our last report, especially at professional, scientific, and technical firms. Additionally, several architectural and engineering firms indicated that their business strengthened somewhat. Although financial services firms reported that activity had improved, a central Virginia broker commented that clients "remained conservative" and were evaluating alternative plans in case the economy worsens. Contacts at healthcare organizations noted little change in demand other than typical seasonal expansion. However, freight trucking firms reported slight softening in the industry. Service providers noted a minor pickup in the pace of price increases.
richmond|Finance|2012|11|Reports on banking conditions varied widely since our last report. An official for a large bank stated that business borrowing softened over the last six weeks, while mortgage demand edged higher. A West Virginia banker said that home equity loans were down, in part due to consumers rolling that debt into their mortgage. A small commercial banker in Virginia described demand in general as improving slightly, but added that consumer loans were unchanged from "meager" levels and small business loans were virtually non-existent. Several loan officers noted that an exception to weak consumer demand was auto loans, but one banker said that even those had weakened in recent weeks. A credit union loan manager reported that consumer loan applications were up and he expected modest gains to continue. Overall loan demand strengthened, according to a northern Virginia banker, mostly for auto loans, home mortgage refinancing, and equipment purchases. Several officials also expressed concern that banks were increasing their risk by making longer termed loans in an effort to get higher yields. Yet, most bankers stated that the quality of their loan portfolio remained healthy, with few delinquencies in recent months.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|11|Residential real estate activity improved modestly since our last report. A Realtor in the Richmond area said that closings were up double digits compared to a year ago. He noted that inventory is very low and prices continued to rise. A contact in South Carolina reported that the single-family segment in the Myrtle Beach market was particularly robust, although the area continued to work down a glut of inventory in the condominium market. A builder in South Carolina cited significant pent-up demand in the first time buyer segment, because many could not get financing, although the move-up market improved. Another builder in South Carolina stated that inventories were moving toward balance and he believed that a real recovery was underway. Similarly, another source reported that there was a steady, slow improvement, and that foreclosures were falling. A contact in Charlotte noticed more residential work in the high-end home category for the first time in more than three years.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|11|Labor markets were more negative on balance than in our last report. Employment agencies reported somewhat stronger demand for temporary workers, but reiterated their difficulty finding qualified workers to fill open positions in manufacturing, aerospace, defense, automotive, and construction. A contact in South Carolina said that labor demand remained fairly soft, with the exception of some IT positions, noting that hiring came to a stop in the third quarter. A Charlotte area temp agency executive reported that manufacturers were unwilling to hire long-term unemployed workers because their skills may have diminished. Manufacturers worried that taking on talent at reduced wages might lead to more turn-over when the economy picks up. A North Carolina contact commented that college graduates who were unable to find full-time work were choosing to remain on unemployment rather than take part-time positions. According to contacts, retail wage growth picked up, while wages at non-retail services firms rose more slowly; manufacturing wage growth also edged up.

According to contacts, retail wage growth picked up, while wages at non-retail services firms rose more slowly; manufacturing wage growth also edged up.
richmond|Tourism|2012|11|Most tourism contacts reported seasonally slower autumn bookings. Several added that, at this time of year, they focus on attracting tourists who are located within a day's drive. There were scattered reports of storm-related hotel cancellations caused by Hurricane Sandy, as tourists from outside the District were affected by the weather at home. In addition, a couple of contacts noted some patches of beach and highway erosion on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and storm-related snow in parts of West Virginia, which might affect near-term visits. However, most planned events continued on schedule. A few District hoteliers stated that they were able to raise rates slightly since our last report.
richmond|Agriculture|2012|11|Agricultural conditions prior to Hurricane Sandy remained favorable. Strong income boosted farm loan repayment rates. Lenders reported a drop in the number of loan renewals and extensions, even as spending for agricultural equipment rose. During October, beef prices rose as farmers struggled with higher feed costs--some producers culled herds, including breeding stock. More recently, Hurricane Sandy's damage was minimal and localized mainly in coastal areas. In Maryland, an analyst reported that small grain emergence may be affected by standing water and salt water flooding. Snow and cold temperatures in North Carolina hindered farm activity and livestock producers were forced to begin feeding hay due to snow covered pastures; fruit production was not affected. In contrast, most farmers in Virginia were relieved that Hurricane Sandy brought much needed rain without significant damage to the corn and soybeans still in the field.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|11|Consumer spending rebounded modestly in October and retailers expected further sales gains during the holidays. District retailers reported that sales rose above year-ago levels, although they were generally below expectations. Several store owners noted particularly strong sales for major appliances and seasonal apparel, in addition to an uptick in demand for premium and custom goods, such as fine jewelry. Auto sales held steady after rising in the last survey period, and sales were expected to improve by year's end. Fuel-efficient cars sold well, while demand for large, expensive cars and trucks remained weak. Tourism contacts reported that visitor counts and tourism spending fell below year-ago levels. Furthermore, hoteliers reduced room rates and noted the fall in hotel occupancy rates was likely to continue in coming months. Restaurant owners reported lower sales revenue and a decline in average check amounts. Some leisure and hospitality contacts attributed the slowdown in sales to high gas prices that limited spending and kept some customers at home.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|11|Although manufacturing activity slowed slightly since the last survey period, sales at transportation and high-tech service firms rebounded. While still above year-ago levels, District manufacturing activity edged lower in October as production of both durable and non-durable goods slowed, most notably at machinery, electronics and food processing plants. In addition, order backlogs fell further and were expected to remain low. The volume of new orders and shipments dropped in October, but were expected to rebound and provide a modest boost to production during the next six months. Capital spending at District factories generally held steady; however, fewer plant managers were hiring and the average work week declined. Trucking traffic picked up, due in part to emergency food shipments to areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Several transportation firms reported an increase in capital spending and a shortage of qualified truck drivers. After easing in the last survey period, business activity at high-tech firms expanded and sales were expected to strengthen in the months ahead. Several business contacts attributed customer delays in ordering to uncertainty regarding the current political, economic and tax environment.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|11|Residential real estate activity remained brisk in October, and commercial real estate activity held firm. A solid rise in home sales reduced home inventories further, with real estate agents noting particular buyer interest in foreclosed properties. Low- and mid-priced homes continued to sell well, while the market for luxury homes and condominiums remained weak. Residential mortgage lenders saw loan applications for home purchases rise above year-ago levels and saw an upswing in loan refinancing activity. Stronger sales supported further home price increases for both existing and new homes. Housing starts were up from the previous survey, but were expected to level off with a seasonal slowdown in construction over the winter months. Sales at construction supply firms rebounded, particularly for lumber products. Commercial real estate markets remained stronger than a year ago and District contacts expected additional strength in coming months. New commercial construction edged up and was expected to hold steady. Commercial sales activity and real estate prices remained above year-ago levels with strong expectations through the end of the year. District contacts expected commercial real estate rents to rise as vacancy rates trended lower. Developers, however, were concerned about the size of down payments and reported a slight deterioration in access to credit.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|11|In the recent survey period, some District bankers reported stronger loan demand, improvements in loan quality and a slight rise in deposit levels. Total loan demand rose moderately, led by gains in demand for real estate loans for both residential and commercial properties. In addition, more bankers reported higher loan demand and lower interest rates for commercial and industrial loans. A few bankers noted continued weakness in consumer installment loan demand. Many bankers reported a moderate improvement in loan quality compared with the last survey with additional quality improvements expected during the next six months. Otherwise, credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|11|High input costs reduced farm profitability and boosted farm loan demand since the last survey period. Demand for farm operating loans rose as surging feed costs cut livestock operator incomes and crop producers paid higher fuel costs to run irrigation and harvest equipment. With reduced incomes, especially for livestock producers, farm loan renewals and extensions edged up and loan repayment rates eased from recent peaks. Still, bankers reported that sufficient funds were available to meet short-term financing needs. Low soil-moisture levels hindered winter wheat emergence, raising concerns that persistent drought could strain U.S. crop production, keep crop and feed prices high, and force further livestock herd liquidations. Farmland values, however, continued to set new record highs in the District.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|11|District energy activity fell in October, but was expected to improve heading into the winter heating season. The number of active oil rigs in the District eased from recent highs as oil prices declined. After falling from summer peaks, the number of natural gas rigs held steady since the last survey and some District contacts expected a seasonal uptick in natural gas prices as winter approached. Wyoming's coal production remained well below year-ago levels as more electricity was being generated from natural gas. District ethanol production edged up, but persistently high corn prices limited profits.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|11|Wage pressures remained subdued during the survey period, raw materials prices rose, and some finished goods prices edged up. Many firms were reluctant to increase wages or hire staff amid political and economic uncertainty. Some businesses, however, were offering higher salaries to recruit workers with specialized skills, such as engineers, software developers, and commercial truck drivers. The cost of raw materials for manufacturing continued to climb, and a few firms were raising finished goods prices. Builders and construction supply companies expected further price increases for construction materials due to Hurricane Sandy. Retail prices edged up but were expected to hold steady during the holiday shopping season. Restaurant owners, however, planned to increase menu prices due to high food costs. Low occupancy rates prompted hotel operators to reduce average room rates.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2012|7|Upward price pressures were very modest during the reporting period. Price declines were noted for selected raw materials and energy inputs, especially gasoline. The declines in selected input costs combined with robust competition among firms in most sectors to hold down final prices for a wide range of retail goods and services. Looking ahead, most contacts expect prices for their products to remain largely unchanged through the balance of the year.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2012|7|Retail sales expanded a bit further overall. Modest sales gains were reported for discount chains as well as traditional department stores, and inventories generally were at or near desired levels given the pace of sales. However, some contacts reported growing concern about a softening of demand in the high-end segment of the market. Demand remained largely flat for retailers of home furnishings and major appliances, as declines in television sales offset increases for flooring and appliances. Similarly, demand stayed largely stable for grocers as consumers remained focused on necessities. The sales pace for new automobiles stayed high, bolstered in part by pent-up demand for Japanese brands whose inventories have returned to normal after being constrained by last year's natural disaster in that country.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2012|7|District manufacturing activity rose a bit further on balance during the reporting period of June through the beginning of July. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products noted continued high rates of capacity utilization and sales but also some emerging softness in demand. For makers of commercial aircraft and parts, an extensive order backlog and additional new orders kept production rates near capacity. Demand for steel was mostly stable at somewhat low levels, and activity weakened a bit for processed scrap metal as a result of a decline in overseas demand. Conditions remained robust in the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. For petroleum refiners, capacity utilization rates were largely stable, as growing export sales offset subdued domestic demand.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2012|7|Demand for agricultural products expanded further, while extraction activity for energy resources was mostly unchanged. Final sales and orders grew for many crop and livestock products. This was stimulated in part by continued growth in overseas exports, although the reports suggested that this source of growth is on the wane. Contacts noted modest declines for input costs, particularly for energy and other petroleum-based products. For energy resources, contacts reported little change in extraction activity for oil and natural gas.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2012|7|Home demand in the District improved modestly overall, and demand for commercial real estate ticked up on net. The sales pace for new and existing homes grew a bit further in many areas, although it stayed well below its historical average. Improvements in the pace of sales helped to reduce the inventory of available homes, prompting additional modest expansion of home construction activity. Similarly, strong demand for rental space spurred further increases in construction of multifamily units. Looking ahead, most contacts expect home sales and prices to improve a bit further during the second half of the year. Demand for commercial real estate inched up, as reflected in slight declines in office and industrial vacancy rates in some parts of the District. Growth in the technology sector continued to support improving demand for nonresidential real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle markets, although the pace of improvement has slowed of late, with contacts noting a recent decline in rental inquiries for vacant properties.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2012|7|District banking contacts reported that loan demand grew a bit during the reporting period. Although most businesses remained highly cautious in their capital spending plans and attitudes toward debt financing, the volume of new commercial and industrial loans expanded further. Demand for consumer credit grew on net, especially for auto loans. Reports continued to indicate stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses, placing downward pressure on rates and fees. Contacts also noted additional improvements in overall credit quality and availability, although lending standards remained somewhat restrictive for most business and consumer loans.
boston|Retail|2012|7|First District retail contacts report that sales range from slightly below to slightly above year-ago levels. Consumer spending continues to be strong for adult clothing and shoes, but spending on furniture and electronics has recently slowed relative to the pace earlier in the year.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2012|7|According to our contacts, the manufacturing sector in the First District continues to grow. However, virtually all of the contacts express some concern about the outlook.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2012|7|Contacts in the First District report that conditions continue to slowly improve in the commercial property market. All contacts, especially those in Boston, note that financing conditions are very favorable for high quality projects. The office market in New England remains flat. Contacts in Boston report difficulty attracting tenants to lower-quality office space and expect vacancy rates to remain steady in the coming months. Contacts believe that the office market is unlikely to improve until the national economy begins to experience robust growth. Construction activity throughout the First District continues to gather momentum, but is mostly limited to the multifamily housing, medical, and higher education sectors. According to contacts, the retail sector is in a holding pattern throughout the First District. Overall, contacts believe that conditions in the New England commercial real estate market are somewhat improved in the last year and, barring a macroeconomic disruption, expect this tepid improvement to continue for the rest of the year.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2012|7|Home and condo sales in the First District showed significant year-over-year increases in May, continuing the trend of the last several months. Contacts attribute the gains to low interest rates, affordable prices, and pent-up demand. A contact from the Greater Boston area adds that improving economic conditions and raising rents in the area have also contributed to sales activity. The consecutive months of growth have improved confidence in the market, but contacts note a recent decrease in momentum compared to previous months. According to most contacts, the pace of market activity has declined slightly, which may be revealed by sales figures in the coming months. Some contacts note that an unseasonably warm winter and spring provided an early boost to sales in the first half of the year, which may account for some softening in activity during the past month. Meanwhile, price changes are mixed across the region. Maine experienced an increase of approximately 7 percent relative to last year while the median sale price in Rhode Island slipped at least 8 percent. Other states in the region experienced relatively modest changes in price levels from a year ago. Some contacts express concern over appraisal practices, claiming banks appraisers are underestimating home values. Inventory levels declined throughout much of the region, particularly in the Greater Boston area.
boston|Selected Business Services|2012|7|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report a steady but generally positive second quarter of 2012. No firm had a bad quarter, but few of the contacts are particularly excited about their results. Contacts report that potential clients are unwilling to commit to projects and instead choose to hold their cash and wait for clearer signals regarding the direction of the economy and the resolution of political and policy questions. Some contacts report a strong second quarter, generally due to factors specific to the industries they primarily serve.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|7|Consumer spending grew moderately. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased 2 percent in June compared with a year ago. Sales at a North Dakota mall during June were up over 5 percent compared with a year earlier. A number of new retail store and restaurant openings were reported in North Dakota. Recent new car and truck sales were up at dealerships in Montana, according to a representative of an auto dealers association. However, recent same-store sales at a Minnesota-based women's apparel retailer were down 15 percent from a year earlier.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2012|7|Commercial construction activity increased since the last report. The value of new commercial building permits issued in Fargo, N.D., so far in 2012 increased compared with the same period in 2011. Commercial permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area were up substantially in value in June from a year earlier. Numerous new commercial building projects were in early stages in the Minneapolis area, including a new headquarters for a large utility and a major expansion at an area hospital. Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential building permits in the Sioux Falls area in June more than doubled from a year earlier. Residential permits increased in value and number in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in June; the single-family sector saw a surprising rebound. Several large multifamily housing projects were under way in Fargo.
minneapolis|Services|2012|7|Activity at professional business services firms grew somewhat since the last report. According to a Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey, District professional business services firms noted gains in revenue and profits over the past three months, while the amount of space occupied held relatively steady. Respondents were mildly optimistic about the upcoming three months regarding revenue and profits. Some contacts noted that competition in the sector has lowered prices and driven down margins, yet projects were more complex and customer expectations were higher than five to 10 years ago.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2012|7|Growth in the District manufacturing sector moderated slightly from the last report. A June survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity expanded in Minnesota and the Dakotas, but at a slightly slower pace than in recent months. A medical equipment maker near Minneapolis announced an expansion into a previously idle facility. A pipe producer announced plans to build a new plant in South Dakota. Plans moved ahead for a potential $1 billion fertilizer plant in North Dakota that would make use of natural gas from the state's oil patch.
minneapolis|Energy and mining|2012|7|Activity in the energy and mining sectors slowed slightly. Oil and gas exploration activity decreased in North Dakota and Montana since the last report, but oil production was at record levels. Reports surfaced of ethanol producers idling plants in response to sharp increases in corn prices in late June and early July, along with declining gasoline prices. District coal-mining operations also saw reductions in demand as electricity generation shifted toward natural gas. A mining company suspended its involvement in a joint project to develop a copper, zinc, and gold mine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. However, hard rock mines in Montana and iron ore producers in northern Minnesota remained busy.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2012|7|District farmers mostly continued to benefit from favorable weather conditions. Drought that was threatening corn and soybean production throughout the Midwest has not had much effect on Minnesota and North Dakota, where most of those crops were rated in good or excellent condition. However, crop quality was somewhat weaker in Wisconsin and in South Dakota, where drought conditions were more prevalent. Prices received by farmers in June--prior to drought damage in other parts of the Midwest--increased from a year earlier for soybeans, hay, dry beans, poultry, and cattle; prices decreased for corn, wheat, hogs, and dairy products.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|7|Some tightening in labor markets was noted since the last report. Across the District, some health care organizations indicated they were planning to hire more workers, a number of retailers noted difficulty finding sales associates to fill open positions, and manufacturers continued to struggle to find skilled welders. According to the aforementioned ad hoc survey of professional business services firms, 28 percent expect to increase hiring over the next three months, while 8 percent expect decreases in staff levels. However, in Minnesota an electronics retailer will lay off an unspecified number of store and technical support workers in the state, a paper company laid off about 260 workers following an explosion at the plant, and a cable company laid off almost 70 salespeople.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2012|7|On balance, District factories reported a slight increase in new orders and production during the past six weeks, although we continued to hear reports about a weakening in orders from European customers. Almost all of our respondents said that output was above year-ago levels. The outlook by manufacturers was mixed. Respondents who sell products to aerospace, auto, and energy companies expect moderate growth in the near term. Other contacts are less certain about growth prospects than they had been a few months earlier. Shipping volume by steel producers and service centers was flat or down slightly, with demand being driven mainly by the transportation and energy sectors. Because of uncertainty about market conditions in the upcoming months, many steel producers are in the process of lowering their inventories. District auto production showed a moderate pick-up during May on a month-over-month basis, while rising substantially from year-ago levels. Increased production year-over-year was attributed mainly to the abatement of supply chain issues.
cleveland|Construction|2012|7|Single-family home construction slowed a bit across the District relative to the March/April time frame, although sales were higher compared to year-ago levels. The outlook by homebuilders is less favorable than in our last report. They believe that the domestic political climate and a lowering in consumer sentiment may hurt sales. Contracts were in all price-point categories, except for the high-end. Buyers are looking to downsize and are noticeably more cost conscious. A few reports indicated an uptick in new-home prices within the Fourth District, though margins are still tight. Volatility in building material prices, which began late in the first quarter, has persisted.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2012|7|Retailers reported little change in sales during May on a month-over-month basis, but sales were higher relative to year-ago levels. Increased revenues were seen across retail categories. Two of our contacts noted that the warm winter weather did not negatively impact consumer spending during the second quarter. Other respondents reported that the rate of growth in purchases of luxury goods has decelerated during the past couple of months. Retailers anticipate that revenues during the third quarter will be above prior-year levels, mainly in the single digits. Vendor prices were fairly stable. Increases were attributed to higher costs for off-shore labor. Little change was noted in store prices. Inventories continued to rise modestly, but they were described as manageable. Capital spending for the year remains on target. No hiring is anticipated, except at new stores, and wage pressures are contained.
cleveland|Banking|2012|7|Bankers reported some easing in demand for business credit. Interest rates remain competitive, especially for refinancings. Loan requests were broad based, with the primary drivers being healthcare, multifamily construction, and shale-gas-related businesses. Little change in consumer credit was noted. Products in highest demand were auto loans (direct and indirect) and home equity lines of credit. Consumer credit pricing trended down slightly. In the residential mortgage market, demand was described as stable to very strong. A high percentage of applicants were looking to refinance, although a few contacts said that they are beginning to see a shift in applications from refinancing to new purchase. Two bankers reported some moderate loosening of auto lending guidelines, otherwise no changes were made to loan application standards. Delinquencies were steady or declined and a few of our respondents cited a drop in credit card delinquencies. Core deposits rose; consumers continued to transition from time-deposit accounts to transaction accounts. One banker reported a moderate reduction in the size of his workforce, while another said that his bank is considering a staff reduction due to the low interest rate environment.
cleveland|Energy|2012|7|Conventional oil and natural gas production was stable, with little change expected in the upcoming weeks. Well-head prices for natural gas remain at very low levels, while crude prices dropped slightly. Permitting in the Utica shale region of Ohio expanded. The number of Utica permits issued by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources during the first half of 2012 equaled the number issued for all of 2011. Drilling in the Utica shale has picked up, mainly by large, out-of-state companies. Coal production this year is expected to fall below 2011 levels due primarily to reduced demand from electric utilities. Spot prices for metallurgical and steam coals declined further. Production equipment and materials prices were flat, and capital outlays were at projected levels. Significant layoffs were announced by one coal producer due to the idling of some of its mining operations. Otherwise, little change was seen in energy payrolls.
cleveland|Transportation|2012|7|Freight transport volume was flat or moved slightly lower during May on a month-over-month basis. Sectors driving demand included energy and transportation along with seasonal products. The outlook for the remainder of 2012 remains positive, but most respondents do not expect that growth will be as strong as they had predicted earlier in the year. Costs associated with truck maintenance and diesel fuel prices continued to stabilize. Capital spending for 2012 remains on plan. Outlays are allocated for the replacement of aging units and adding capacity. However, some slowing in spending might occur due to concerns about economic growth and industry consolidation. One contact noted that he is finalizing plans for a terminal expansion in the eastern part of the District. Companies are hiring for replacement and capacity expansion. Wage pressure exists due to a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|7|District retail sales activity improved slightly in June and early July, but merchants reported that consumers remained very conservative. Several discount retailers and auto dealers signaled strong sales, while most department stores conveyed more modest activity. Restaurant and food service contacts reported that demand had softened a bit, but sales at higher-end establishments remained strong.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2012|7|District residential brokers indicated that home sales were flat to slightly up compared with year-ago levels. Reports indicated strong sales at the middle price points, while several brokers noted that declining inventories of foreclosed homes were limiting investor-driven sales. Brokers also reported that the decline in inventories has helped stabilize home prices in many areas. Most brokers reported that home prices were flat to slightly up compared with a year earlier. However, contacts continued to note some downward pressure on home prices resulting from low purchase offers and appraisals that were coming in well-below asking and offering prices. The sales outlook among brokers remained positive with most anticipating continued modest year-over-year home sales gains.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2012|7|Manufacturing contacts indicated that the pace of new orders and production growth remained positive, but had moderated. A major European-based aircraft manufacturer announced it will locate its first American manufacturing facility in Alabama. A Florida manufacturer, closely tied to the construction industry, reported improved but volatile business conditions based on increases in construction of multi-family dwellings, healthcare facilities, and construction at ports.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2012|7|Banking contacts noted some improvement in residential mortgage lending. Auto loans continued to be a source of strength, while commercial and industrial lending remained soft. Contacts reported significant competition among lenders for credit-worthy customers. Bankers indicated that low interest rates, coupled with a limited number of qualified borrowers, continued to squeeze bank margins.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2012|7|Regional employment growth remained positive, but muted. Employers continued to cite uncertainty regarding future economic conditions as a reason for limiting hiring and recent economic volatility appears to have exacerbated these anxieties. Small stores with very low price points reported doing well and were expanding with significant hiring plans across the District. Contacts continued to note difficulty in finding qualified applicants for many highly-technical positions, and some reported problems finding candidates for some lower-skilled positions. Many manufacturing and trucking contacts continued to note challenges in attracting applicants with necessary skills. The skills mismatch problem has been especially hard on low-wage individuals, according to community and economic development contacts.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2012|7|Contacts continued to report that investment in expanding and maintaining existing transportation infrastructure would be necessary to accommodate increases in domestic oil and natural gas production. Contacts have noted a steady increase in capital expenditures on refineries for upgrades and expansions. Deep-water permits for offshore drilling have increased. Varying levels of drought conditions had expanded through much of the District resulting in stress to some crops. However, the June tropical storm helped some areas. Compared with last year, June's prices paid to farmers were down for cotton and corn while prices for oranges, beef, and soybeans increased.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2012|7|Retailers report that sales activity has been somewhat softer since the last report. One major retail chain indicates that sales were down noticeably from a year earlier, with home goods sales especially weak. Another major chain reports that sales slowed in June and were running somewhat below plan but still up marginally from a year earlier; however, some improvement was noted during the first few days of July. Retail contacts in upstate New York report that sales were mixed in May but picked up in June, again buoyed by Canadian shoppers. Retail prices continue to be described as steady. Inventories are generally said to be at or slightly above desired levels.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2012|7|Housing markets across much of the District have improved somewhat since the last report, while rental markets have continued to strengthen. Both the volume of Manhattan apartment sales and selling prices were steady in the second quarter; sales of smaller apartments have picked up and account for a growing share of the market. Foreign buyers continue to be a fairly big component of demand at the higher end of New York City's market. Housing markets in Long Island and Westchester County are reported to have improved in the second quarter: sales activity has picked up, prices have stabilized, and the inventory of available homes, though high, has begun to decline. Existing home sales and prices in northern New Jersey have been flat, hampered by a glut of distressed properties on the market; but there has been a modest pickup in new home sales, as well as construction starts. Real estate contacts in Western New York continue to report robust sales activity and rising prices, despite "tough" mortgage conditions. New York City's apartment rental market continued to strengthen in the second quarter, with inventories tight and rents increasing--most notably on smaller and lower priced apartments.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2012|7|Contacts across the District indicate that business activity has leveled off since the last report. Business contacts in both manufacturing and other sectors indicate little change in general conditions, but manufacturing contacts in New York State report a pullback in both new and unfilled orders. In addition, business contacts in manufacturing and other sectors note a leveling off in input prices and steady to declining selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2012|7|Responses from small- to medium-sized banks in the District suggest no change in loan demand overall. For specific loan categories, bankers report increased demand for home mortgage loans, but decreased demand for commercial & industrial loans. Bankers also indicate steady to increasing demand for refinancing. The vast majority of contacts report no change in credit standards across all loan categories. Respondents indicate continued decreases in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly commercial & industrial loans and commercial mortgages. Respondents also note increasingly widespread declines in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers report a decrease in delinquency rates on commercial loans and mortgages but steady rates on loans to the household sector.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2012|7|The pace of growth in consumer spending further moderated in June and early July. Retailers cited lower consumer confidence, a weaker customer response to promotions, and extreme summer heat as the main contributors to the lower sales pace. However, some exceptions were noted. Demand for luxury goods remained stronger by comparison, and sales of clothing, furniture, and home furnishings improved. In addition, the hot weather sparked sales of swimming pools, fans, and air conditioning units. Auto sales also improved, driven in large part by fleet sales and an increase in manufacturers' incentives on new fuel efficient vehicles. Inventory levels were little changed, but some auto dealers indicated that they were adjusting their inventory mix to include more fuel efficient vehicles in order to meet increased demand.
chicago|Business Spending|2012|7|Business spending continued to increase at a steady pace in June and early July. Inventories were generally reported to be at comfortable levels, and most contacts indicated that capital expenditures were proceeding as planned. Auto dealers reported facility upgrades and a number of manufacturers indicated they were purchasing new equipment. That said, many contacts had become more cautious about future spending decisions, pointing to the heightened uncertainty surrounding the federal fiscal environment and the upcoming November elections. Labor market conditions were little changed on balance. Part-time hiring increased on par with seasonal norms in retail trade, although permanent workforces decreased slightly. Manufacturers reported only moderate gains in employment, but several did note increasing the hours of their existing workforce. A staffing firm reported weaker demand from the manufacturing, transportation, and business services industries but an increase in the growth rate of billable hours in the construction and financial services industries.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2012|7|Construction continued to increase in June and early July. Multi-family residential construction remained an area of strength, particularly apartments, but single-family construction also increased. Residential real estate conditions continued to improve, with home prices and rents both edging up. A contact noted a rise in short sales as a side effect of lenders increasingly looking to avoid the still drawn out foreclosure process. Demand for nonresidential construction also rose. Contacts reported several new hotel and office projects as well as a pick-up in warehousing, industrial, and infrastructure building activity. Commercial real estate conditions were little changed overall. Vacancy rates remained elevated for retail and office properties. Contacts expected that it would take a while for the pace of absorption to pick up significantly despite an increase in capital available for the purchase of commercial properties.
chicago|Manufacturing|2012|7|production increased at a slower pace in June and early July. The auto sector remained a source of strength. Several auto suppliers noted an increase in research and development activity, as automakers were shifting responsibility for new product design and development away from their in-house operations. Outside of the auto industry, conditions were mixed. Capacity utilization in the steel industry edged lower; and while metals manufacturers indicated that orders continued to increase, they also noted that growth had softened some from the robust pace earlier in the year. Exports to Canada and Mexico continued to increase, but exporters noted a decline in demand from Europe and China. Demand for heavy equipment was steady, but a few contacts noted that it may soon be slowing. While freight traffic continued to be strong, the demand for heavy trucks was expected to be flat into next year in advance of the next round of changes in emissions standards. The lower price of natural gas was noted to have slowed activity in the industry, as natural gas demand lagged available supply. Contacts indicated that orders from the defense industry further weakened in anticipation of additional defense spending cuts in the coming fiscal year.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2012|7|Credit conditions improved slightly on balance from the previous reporting period. Demand for longer term financing continued to increase. Credit spreads edged up, but market interest rates declined so that net corporate funding costs were essentially flat. There was steady growth in refinancing and lending for capital replacement, but limited loan demand for other purposes. Middle market firms were the primary source of loan growth. Larger firms were said to have been more significantly impacted by the weakening European economy and have scaled back their borrowing accordingly. Banking contacts also noted that uncertainty over the effects of potential fiscal policy actions on both demand and costs was reducing their customers' demand for credit. In contrast, consumer loan demand increased moderately, particularly for auto loans and mortgage refinancing.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2012|7|Cost pressures decreased in June and early July. Energy prices were noticeably lower. Other commodity prices also decreased, with contacts pointing to steel and lumber as examples. Lead times for some specialty metals remained extended, however. Wholesale price pressures eased, particularly for clothing. Wage pressures continued to be moderate. Manufacturing contacts reiterated having difficulty filling open positions for high-skill trades.
chicago|Agriculture|2012|7|Extreme heat and drought conditions spread across most of the District, stressing both crops and livestock. Forecasts made in June called for possibly record crops of corn and soybeans; now it appears the District's harvest will likely be below average, with little prospect for improvement and plenty of downside risk. The corn crop is in the most danger of further damage, as plants entered a critical stage of development with insufficient moisture. Corn and soybean prices moved sharply higher, and wheat prices also rose. Hog prices were higher, cattle prices were little changed, and milk prices moved lower. With higher costs and the outlook for a decline in revenue, insurance coverage may provide an important safeguard for many farmers this year. Insurance coverage is widespread for corn and soybeans, but is less prevalent for some other products. Furthermore, several years of higher-than-usual farm income have left many operations in a better position to absorb losses this year.
dallas|Prices|2012|7|Most responding firms said prices were unchanged from the last reporting period. However, accounting firms noted a modest rise in rates, airlines reported higher fares, and some construction-related manufacturers said they were able to raise selling prices as a result of improved demand. Overall, input costs were flat to down, with reports of lower prices for cotton, scrap metal, and steel. The recent decline in fuel prices lowered costs for airlines and freight transportation firms.
dallas|Labor Market|2012|7|Most responding firms said employment levels were flat to up slightly. Staffing firms reported demand remained steady at very high levels and noted rising demand for financial analysts, steel and metal fabricators, and construction workers. Reports of hiring came from some retailers, automobile dealers, and primary metals, lumber, paper, and food manufacturers. Wage pressures remained minimal, although legal contacts said raises and bonuses had improved, and rising wages were noted for manufacturing workers with specialized skills such as machine operators.
dallas|Manufacturing|2012|7|Overall demand for construction-related products held steady since the last report, and respondents' outlooks have become slightly more guarded. Producers of stone, clay, and glass reported improved demand and higher capacity utilization rates compared to earlier in the year. Contacts in the lumber industry noted a pickup in demand, while primary metals manufacturers reported slight declines. Producers of fabricated metals reported steady sales activity, but said they were concerned about the continuity of some private projects.
dallas|Retail Sales|2012|7|Retail sales increased but the pace of growth decelerated slightly compared to earlier in the year. Sales of apparel, bedding, household items, and small furniture fared well. Discount retailers said sales of food and sundries continued to perform the strongest. Overall sales growth in the Eleventh District continued to outpace the nation, on average, according to three large retailers. Outlooks are cautiously optimistic and contacts say it appears as if the environment has improved slightly for the consumer.
dallas|Services|2012|7|Demand for staffing services remained steady at very high levels, and contacts noted an increase in orders for financial analysts, construction workers, and steel and metal fabricators. Outlooks were mostly positive but slightly more cautious than the last report. Accounting firms noted a seasonal slowdown in demand. Demand for energy and audit-related services increased modestly while advisory, transactional, and tax services activity softened slightly. Legal firms reported a pickup in demand, with continued strength in real estate, intellectual property, energy, and tax-related services.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2012|7|Contacts in the single-family housing industry said demand picked up over the past six weeks. Respondents noted that demand was outstripping supply in some areas, leading to falling inventories. Construction activity was picking up as result. Realtors and builders remained cautiously optimistic. Apartment market respondents continued to report solid demand. While rental rates continued to rise, the pace slowed slightly. Apartment construction activity is expected to pick up in coming months.
dallas|Financial Services|2012|7|Overall, financial firms reported mixed loan demand. National banks said middle-market lending declined, while auto and energy lending activity remained positive. Regional and community banks noted improvement in C&I and commercial real estate lending. Consumer lending appeared to be steady, with strong mortgage demand and a healthy backlog of loans in the pipeline. Loan pricing remained competitive at very low rates. The quality of outstanding loans continued to improve slowly and deposit growth was mixed. Outlooks are slightly more pessimistic than the last report in part due to European debt issues and regulatory and political uncertainty.
dallas|Energy|2012|7|Respondents at energy-related firms said activity remained strong, and the District rig count grew modestly over the past six weeks. The rapid shift from dry-gas drilling to oil-directed drilling has not reduced the overall pace of activity, and business remains strong with long lead times and growing backlogs. Activity in the Gulf of Mexico increased further, and the success of a recent auction of offshore acreage suggests continued interest in the region.
dallas|Agriculture|2012|7|Agricultural conditions deteriorated slightly due to hot and dry weather. Planting neared completion and crops were mostly in fair to good shape, with conditions much better than a year ago. Since the last report, livestock producers have seen pastures dry out, cattle prices fall, and feed costs increase. Crop prices generally increased over the past six weeks, particularly for corn, although cotton prices fell sharply.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|7|Reports of plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to decrease operations and lay off workers. Firms in auto, appliance, wall coverings, stone wool insulation, food, construction machinery, factory components, and packaging and label manufacturing reported plans to hire new workers, expand operations, and build new plants. In contrast, a window coverings manufacturing firm reported plans to lay off workers.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2012|7|Home sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, May 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 15 percent in Louisville, 7 percent in Little Rock, 21 percent in Memphis, and 19 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District over the same period. May 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits increased 45 percent in Louisville, 26 percent in Little Rock, 41 percent in Memphis, and 25 percent in St. Louis.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2012|7|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased 0.7 percent from mid-March to mid-June. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.3 percent of total loans, increased 0.6 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.8 percent of total loans, decreased 2.0 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of total loans, increased 0.3 percent. All other loans, accounting for 6.2 percent of total loans, increased 9.7 percent. During this period, total deposits at these banks decreased 0.6 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|7|As of the end of June, the majority of cotton, corn, soybean, sorghum, and rice crop conditions were rated as fair or better in all District states with the exception of sorghum crop conditions in Illinois. Winter wheat harvests were either complete or close to completion, and more than 88 percent of the crop conditions were rated as fair or better. However, the fraction of pasture and range in good condition or better decreased in all District states since the previous report. The District's year-to-date coal production for the end of June was 4.8 percent higher compared with the same period last year. However, the District's coal production for June 2012 was 5 percent lower than in June 2011.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2012|7|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported declines in shipments and new orders. Gains  some seasonal  continued among the makers of industrial machinery. Makers of food products, lumber and wood products, primary metals, fabricated metals, electronic equipment, and instruments reported a falloff in demand. A few contacts mentioned a slowdown of Marcellus shale activity as a factor in weaker demand.
philadelphia|Retail|2012|7|Third District retailers at major malls reported stronger year-over-year sales in May than in April, while outlet centers reported lower growth in May and June than in previous months. At malls, high-end goods, including Apple products and jewelry, did especially well. Sales of children's clothing were down year-over-year at outlet centers for the first time since 2007; typically a negative signal, this time it may reflect a delay in deep discounting of back-to-school items that had already been discounted by this time last year.  contacts remain cautiously optimistic.
philadelphia|Finance|2012|7|Contacts from the Third District's financial sector report continued slow improvement since the previous Beige Book. The very slow increase in demand is reflected in uneven reports, with some lenders reporting increases primarily as gains in market share, while others are shifting into and out of various lending segments. Bank contacts report frequent requests from business borrowers for loan modifications, while home refinancings have slowed recently. Most contacts report strong, improving credit quality as households and businesses pay down debt early and build cash reserves. Many contacts report that businesses have adjusted to the "new normal" and anticipate little new growth "through the election and after."
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2012|7|Residential builders report little change in their level of activity since the last Beige Book. Traffic remained relatively strong, but contract signings remained elusive and weaker than in the first quarter. While uncertainty remains and recent sales were disappointing, high levels of interest continue to encourage builders on their prospects over the next few months. Contacts report a few new developments in select markets and limited hiring to facilitate strategic growth objectives. Residential brokers reported improving year-over-year home sales in May, and inventory has fallen significantly over the past two years in most markets. Bidding wars reported in a few markets for low-end homes signal that prices in those markets have likely found a bottom. The outlook among builders and brokers remains cautiously positive.
philadelphia|Services|2012|7|Most Third District service-sector firms continue to report little change from the slow but positive growth reported in the last Beige Book. One contact captured the thoughts of many by describing the economy as "orderly, functioning, nothing exciting." Staffing firms report some seasonal uptick in hiring, but little change in overall demand or expectations. A few firms report opportunistic investments to capture market share, enter new markets, or take advantage of growth in emerging economies, such as Brazil. Election-year advertising has been a boon for some firms. However, election-year uncertainty and the slowdown in Europe and China have sidelined investment plans for many firms for the remainder of the year. Overall, service-sector firms retain a positive, but cautious, outlook for growth.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2012|7|Price levels have eased further since the previous Beige Book and remain generally constrained. Falling gas prices have contributed to the recent broader price easing. Manufacturing firms have reported lower cost factors since the last Beige Book. Home builders continue to report rising cost pressures for materials and limited ability to pass these costs along. Retailers also continue to report tight margins. Nearly all contacts report an ongoing lack of wage pressures, other than for medical benefits. House prices have stabilized in many areas for low-end homes but continue to fall for high-end homes.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2012|7|Most Districts reported modest increases in retail spending on a year-over-year basis, but many reported slower growth in recent months compared with earlier in the year; however, Boston and Cleveland reported sales as flat, and New York cited softer sales. There were a few reports that high summer temperatures negatively affected sales. Sales of big-ticket household goods were strong in the Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while sales were reportedly flat for home furnishings and major appliances in the San Francisco District. Boston reported that sales for furniture and electronics had slowed, and retailers in the New York District reported that home goods sales were weak. Reports from luxury-goods retailers were mixed. Firms in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported that sales of high-end goods remained strong, while retailers in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts indicated demand had softened, and those in the Cleveland District noted that sales of luxury goods had slowed. Most Districts reported that vehicle sales remained robust. Demand was high for fuel-efficient vehicles in particular. Looking forward, merchants in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts were concerned that economic uncertainty could result in restrained sales growth, while retailers in the Cleveland District anticipated that the third quarter will be higher compared with year-ago levels. Kansas City noted that merchants there expected further strengthening in the coming months.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2012|7|Reports on residential housing markets remained largely positive. Sales were characterized as improving in Philadelphia, New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, while home sales increased in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, reports on sales were mixed in the New York District, and gains in the Boston District eased from earlier in the year. New home sales were described as disappointing in the Philadelphia District. Construction increased in the New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while reports from the Cleveland District said construction slowed. Most Districts reported declines in home inventories. Homes prices have begun to stabilize in some markets and price increases were noted in select markets. Boston and Atlanta noted that appraisals were coming in below market prices.
summary|Manufacturing|2012|7|continued to expand in June and early July in most Districts, but at a more modest pace compared with earlier in the year. Several Districts reported that new orders had moderated since the last report, but the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts were more optimistic that new orders would rebound. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts however, reported declines in shipments and orders. The passing of a transportation bill through Congress led contacts in the Philadelphia District to express interest in increasing their capital spending. Capacity utilization rates at refineries and petrochemical manufacturing facilities held steady in the San Francisco District, with weaker domestic demand being offset by growing exports. Meanwhile, manufacturers in the Dallas District reported operating at above 90 percent utilization rates to catch up with below-normal inventory levels.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2012|7|Demand for nonfinancial services was generally stable to slightly stronger since the previous report. Richmond noted that revenue improvement was strong among professional, scientific, and technical firms. Strength in energy, legal, and audit-related services was noted in the Dallas District. Advertisers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts reported strong revenues, and consulting and advertising contacts in the Boston District noted steady activity. Richmond and San Francisco reported that restaurants were busy, while food service contacts in Atlanta reported that demand had softened a bit.
summary|Banking and Financial Services|2012|7|Overall loan demand grew modestly in most Districts. New York indicated no change, while Richmond observed flat-to-weakening loan demand. Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted increased commercial and industrial lending, but lending in that sector decreased somewhat in the New York District and was characterized as soft in Cleveland and Atlanta. Most Districts reported an increase in mortgage lending, with Dallas noting especially strong demand and a healthy backlog of loans. Refinancing of mortgage loans was steady or increasing in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago, but Philadelphia noted a recent slowdown. Kansas City and Dallas noted some improvement in lending for agriculture and commercial real estate. The Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts observed steady-to-increasing demand for consumer credit, especially for auto loans, while consumer loan demand was somewhat weaker in Kansas City and little changed in Cleveland.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2012|7|Agricultural conditions were mixed since the previous report. Several Districts noted areas of increased drought resulting in stress to crops and livestock, while rainfall provided needed moisture to parts of the Atlanta District. With high heat and drought cited as the cause, the Chicago and Kansas City Districts reported concerns for their corn and soybean crops, while the Minneapolis District reported that favorable weather conditions contributed to their corn and soybean crops doing well. The Kansas City and Dallas Districts reported drought-stressed pasture conditions, although the Dallas District noted much better crop conditions than this time last year. The St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported better-than-expected yields for the winter wheat crop nearing completion. The San Francisco District noted further sales growth for many crop and livestock products, attributed in part to overseas growth, but suggested that this source of growth was decreasing. The Kansas City District cited rising export demand as the reason some hog producers expanded production. Agricultural price reports were mixed. While June corn prices were reported down on a year-over-year basis, reports of corn crop deterioration was noted by the Chicago and Kansas City Districts as having pushed corn prices sharply higher since the end of June.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2012|7|Employment levels grew at a tepid pace for most Districts since the last report. The Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts said employment levels were flat to up slightly, with most contacts citing U.S. fiscal policy uncertainty or weak demand for their conservative approach to hiring. Kansas City said employers were reluctant to increase wages or hire full-time staff until economic uncertainty diminishes. A Richmond District employment agency contact noted an increase in temporary employment turning into permanent positions since the last report. The Atlanta District noted some smaller chain stores with low price points were expanding and hiring at a significant pace. Several Districts noted that employers were having difficulty filling highly skilled positions.
richmond|Manufacturing|2012|7|District manufacturing weakened in June, following six months of moderate expansion. A manufacturer of industrial machinery reported that business had slowed during the last month and that major customers were withholding payments. A producer of gas turbines said that economic problems in Europe had reduced his company's exports by fifty percent. A textile producer noted that his company had reduced capacity at a District plant by approximately twenty percent due to decreased demand from domestic customers. Backlogs of orders had gone from four weeks to day-by-day, according to a modular home manufacturer. He added that his company was not in a position to raise prices to keep up with costs. A producer of electrical equipment mentioned that orders had decreased noticeably during the last month, and that several large customers had scaled back their order projections due to recent economic uncertainty. In addition, several aerospace manufacturers said that airlines were making money but were not adding capacity. Our latest manufacturing survey indicated that prices of raw materials and finished goods grew more slowly over the past month.
richmond|Retail|2012|7|Sales among District retailers strengthened since our last report, buttressed by big-ticket purchases. Spending picked up for construction-related items, computers, and big-ticket items at home and garden stores. Sales of automobiles also rose, according most dealers we contacted. However, shopper traffic generally waned, according to our most recent survey, and inventory accumulation picked up. Distributors of non-durable goods and building materials merchants reported improved revenues since our last report. Grocery wholesalers also saw revenue gains. The store manager of a large sporting goods establishment noted that sales were up, even with less traffic. He commented that cotton prices had declined, although freight shippers continued to apply gas surcharges. Large areas of the mid-Atlantic lost power for up to a week following strong storms at the end of June; a retailer in the Richmond area reported having to place extra orders for generators as his stock depleted. He noted that bottled water sold out quickly, and sales of battery operated lights and flashlights rose sharply.  prices increased at a somewhat faster pace since our last report.
richmond|Services|2012|7|Non-retail services providers reported stable to slightly greater revenue gains in recent weeks. In our most recent survey, revenue improvement was strongest among professional, scientific, and technical firms. A financial services broker in central Virginia cited stable demand, but also noted a general nervousness among his clients regarding "the European situation." Healthcare services providers generally reported little change in demand. Following the Supreme Court's healthcare decision, organizations continued to prepare for upcoming changes. A restaurant owner stated that the recent power outage cost him "some product," and reservations dropped because his phones were down for several days. Price increases at services-providing firms slowed in recent weeks.
richmond|Finance|2012|7|We received varied reports on loan demand since our last assessment. Characteristic of many anecdotes, a Maryland banker described his lending activity as "very slow, very flat," with most loans going to refinancing. A loan officer in North Carolina indicated that, while his pipeline was slowing, real estate loan applications for construction projects had improved and even mortgage applications were beginning to "show some life." An official for a large bank noted modest growth in new loans that were mostly from home buyers and small businesses, while consumer installment loans were down. A banker in western Virginia stated that loan demand for capital improvements from local governments was increasing as federal stimulus funds run out. Finally, an official for a midsize commercial bank reported that his market area seemed to be "moving sideways," with borrowers shifting among local banks to get refinancing at lower rates. Most bankers described their lending standards as unchanged, although one lender noted that competitive pressures for commercial loans had caused some easing in standards to capture high-quality loans.
richmond|Real Estate|2012|7|Residential real estate activity improved slightly since our last report. A Realtor in the Charlotte area said that homes in the mid-price range were selling quickly in her area and that prices were rising. An agent in the D.C. area indicated that properties in the $800,000-plus range were selling somewhat more quickly, and added that continuing low inventory and low interest rates should contribute to strong sales throughout the summer. Moreover, a Maryland contact noted that trends in the housing sector were generally showing some improvement, with sales and prices rising and active inventory declining. However, a South Carolina Realtor reported that housing in coastal areas was not doing well, which he attributed, in part, to an inventory overhang that was placing downward pressure on prices. A North Carolina housing agent mentioned that the state had proposed a cut in unemployment benefits, which threatened to put more stress on the slowing housing market.
richmond|Labor Markets|2012|7|Fifth District labor market activity was slightly weaker since our last report. Several contacts at employment agencies characterized demand as somewhat slower, compared to a year ago, with one agent noting that the "hiring surge" earlier in the year had slowed. Other employment agents cited strong demand for workers with high-end IT and manufacturing skills. For example, a Hagerstown agent said that, while overall demand for entry-level workers had tapered off, clients were still looking for middle-management, supervisors and highly skilled workers. Similarly, a furniture manufacturer reported difficulty finding skilled employees through temp agencies, which he attributed to potential workers dropping out of the work force or signing up for unemployment. However, a contact for an employment agency in North Carolina noted some improvement in hiring activity, with an increase in temp-to-permanent status. According to our latest survey, wage gains in both the manufacturing and service sectors were a bit more widespread than a month ago.
richmond|Tourism|2012|7|Hoteliers reported solid summer bookings since our last report. A contact on the outer banks of North Carolina said tourist activity remained strong following an early "jump-start" to the vacation season. She noted that restaurants in that location were busy, but that tips were a bit lower than usual as families tried to vacation on a smaller budget. Hotel managers said vacationers continued to seek bargains, and corporate and military travel had softened in part because of pending government actions affecting spending decisions. A Virginia hotel contact reported a massive increase in bookings following severe storms at the end of June, which caused local power outages that lasted past the July 4th holiday.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2012|7|Consumer spending improved with stronger than expected sales in June and was expected to strengthen further in the coming months. District retailers reported increased sales, particularly for seasonal items, mid-priced appliances, apparel, and fashion accessories. Several high-end retailers, however, commented that economic uncertainty had slowed demand for luxury items. Auto sales climbed sharply and were expected to remain solid for the next few months with more dealers offering sales incentives and discounts. Fuel-efficient cars sold well, while demand for large, expensive cars and trucks remained weak. Restaurant sales increased more than expected as both the number of diners and average check amounts edged up in June. Tourism activity ramped up with the start of the summer vacation season, though wildfires in Colorado hurt traffic in the Rocky Mountain region. District hotel owners reported a sharp rise in occupancy at higher average room rates and expected bookings to remain strong during the next three months.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2012|7|Manufacturing and transportation activity edged up in June and sales at high-tech service firms rose modestly. Following a moderate rebound in May, District factory activity edged higher in June and remained well above year-ago levels, with stronger production at food processing and aircraft manufacturers. The volume of new orders fell in June but was expected to rebound and provide a moderate boost to production during the next six months. A rise in the volume of shipments reduced order backlogs and trimmed finished goods inventories. Capital spending held steady, but fewer plant managers were hiring as the average work week declined. Most manufacturers indicated that the economic situation in Europe indirectly affected business activity by increasing the uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions and future demand. After easing in the last survey period, transportation activity picked up, particularly in the trucking industry. A modest rise in sales at high-tech firms fell short of expectations but several companies anticipated stronger sales in the months ahead.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2012|7|Stronger residential home sales reduced home inventories and commercial construction activity grew in June. A sharp increase in home sales reduced home inventories, particularly for low- and mid-priced houses. Stronger sales supported a moderate increase in home prices and real estate contacts expected additional sales and price gains during the next three months. Residential mortgage lenders saw an upswing in loan applications for home purchases while home loan refinancing activity was stable. Sales at construction supply firms remained solid and some building materials were in short supply. Builders, however, reported a lull in new home starts following the spring construction rush, but building activity was expected to pick up during the next three months. After climbing during the last survey period, new commercial construction edged up and was expected to rise further with more projects in the planning stages. Commercial real estate prices firmed with stronger sales activity, and real estate contacts noted owners were making fewer concessions to facilitate deals. Commercial real estate rents rose as vacancy rates fell further. Developers reported little change in access to credit.
kansas_city||2012|7|Real Estate and Construction       Stronger residential home sales reduced home inventories and commercial construction activity grew in June. A sharp increase in home sales reduced home inventories, particularly for low- and mid-priced houses. Stronger sales supported a moderate increase in home prices and real estate contacts expected additional sales and price gains during the next three months. Residential mortgage lenders saw an upswing in loan applications for home purchases while home loan refinancing activity was stable. Sales at construction supply firms remained solid and some building materials were in short supply. Builders, however, reported a lull in new home starts following the spring construction rush, but building activity was expected to pick up during the next three months. After climbing during the last survey period, new commercial construction edged up and was expected to rise further with more projects in the planning stages. Commercial real estate prices firmed with stronger sales activity, and real estate contacts noted owners were making fewer concessions to facilitate deals. Commercial real estate rents rose as vacancy rates fell further. Developers reported little change in access to credit.
kansas_city|Banking|2012|7|In the recent survey period, some District bankers reported modest improvements in loan demand and loan quality with little change in deposit levels. In general, loan demand rose moderately, led by gains in residential mortgage loans and slight upticks in both commercial real estate and agricultural loan demand. Bankers reported steady commercial and industrial loan activity at slightly lower interest rates and a few bankers reported weaker consumer installment loan demand. Some bankers noted that loan quality improved moderately over the past month with addition quality improvements expected over the next six months. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories and bank deposits held steady.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2012|7|Agricultural growing conditions deteriorated substantially since the last survey period as drought spread across the District. Extremely hot, dry weather hindered crop development and more than half of the District's corn and soybean crops were rated in fair or worse condition. Crop prices rose sharply as intensifying drought and few prospects of precipitation cut corn and soybean yield forecasts. The winter wheat harvest was nearly complete with better than expected yields in some regions. To preserve drought-stressed pastures, some cattle ranchers were considering selling feeder calves early, especially with high feeder cattle prices. Losses mounted for feedlot operators as feed costs soared. Rising export demand enticed some hog producers to expand production. Strong farm and nonfarm investor demand drove farmland prices higher.
kansas_city|Energy|2012|7|District energy activity held at historically high levels in June but was expected to ease in the coming months. The number of active oil and natural gas rigs in the District held steady with a rise in active oil rigs offsetting declines in active natural gas rigs. Some business contacts expected drilling activity to slow with current supplies adequate to satisfy summer demand, especially if economic uncertainty in Europe trims global demand and keeps oil prices below spring highs. In contrast, a few District contacts expected a slight uptick in natural gas prices as hot weather boosted demand for electric power generated by natural gas. Wyoming's coal production fell further as some electricity production shifted from coal to natural gas. District ethanol production slowed as rising corn prices and lower gasoline prices cut profits at ethanol firms.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2012|7|Wage pressures remained subdued during the survey period, raw materials prices edged up, and finished goods prices generally held steady. Many firms were reluctant to increase wages or hire new staff until economic uncertainty diminishes. Some businesses, however, were offering higher salaries to recruit workers with specialized skills such as engineers, software developers, mechanics, and commercial truck drivers. Some transportation companies charged less for freight hauling in light of reduced fuel costs. The cost of raw materials for manufacturing rose at a slower pace compared to previous survey periods and most finished goods prices remained stable. Retailers held selling prices steady and did not anticipate raising prices during the next three months. Restaurant owners, however, planned to increase menu prices due to high food costs. High occupancy rates prompted hotel operators to raise average room rates. Builders and construction supply companies noted rising prices for some construction materials, particularly drywall and asphalt shingles.
san_francisco|Prices and Wages|2013|7|Price inflation was minimal for most final goods and services. Food industry contacts noted price increases for some protein items, including fish, poultry, and beef. Reports from health-care organizations mentioned that the pace of increases in insurance premiums has slowed. Competitive industry pressures constrained fees for legal and accounting services. Driven by demand, prices of some construction inputs, such as logs, edged up further.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2013|7|Retail sales grew modestly. Grocery and apparel retailers noted modest sales growth at retail store locations and relatively strong sales growth online. The retail grocery industry in particular appears to be shifting away from traditional large stores and towards e-commerce. Most contacts' outlook for consumer spending improved slightly since the prior reporting period. Contacts noted that an increase in demand for new devices has spurred some technology firms to expand their medium-term hiring plans. Suppliers of food and beverage products noted improved conditions, although sales of selected discretionary items, such as pet supplies, were a bit soft. As home purchases have increased, so has spending on housing-related products, such as furniture. New and used automobile sales were robust, and some dealers expanded their inventories in anticipation of a further pickup in summer sales.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2013|7|District manufacturing activity grew overall in the reporting period of late May through early July. Although demand was weak for some electronic components, contacts indicated substantial increases in new orders for semiconductors. Led by launches of innovative products, demand for pharmaceuticals gained further. Wood product manufacturers appeared to ramp up output to levels that exceeded demand in recent weeks. As such, firms are expected to pare back production plans for the second half of the year. Demand for steel products used primarily in nonresidential construction continued to increase. Steel producers reported that capacity utilization ticked up a bit further, and reports of intensified energy usage across multiple goods-producing sectors in the Pacific Northwest implied improved capacity utilization in the region.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2013|7|Agricultural sales and production activity expanded. Demand was strong for most crop and livestock products. However, some contacts expressed concern about the lack of availability of manual laborers. Insufficient water also was a concern in parts of the District, with this year's rain and snow pack levels running well below seasonal norms. Contacts from the oil and gas industry faced challenges finding qualified geologists, geophysicists, and drillers to fill open positions. Inventories of natural gas rose further, and demand for gasoline edged up. Reports from the utilities industry indicated that business demand for electricity from wood products and aerospace firms has risen robustly, although overall demand growth was more modest.

Reports from the utilities industry indicated that business demand for electricity from wood products and aerospace firms has risen robustly, although overall demand growth was more modest.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2013|7|Demand for housing strengthened substantially, and commercial real estate activity continued to trend up in most areas. Both sales transactions and house prices climbed further in many District cities. The pace of housing starts exceeded the expectations of some contacts. In some areas, the supply of homes for sale remained low, and some properties have received multiple offers from prospective buyers. Construction of multifamily residential projects increased on balance. Commercial real estate activity expanded rapidly in some major metropolitan areas, even though construction of publicly funded commercial projects has slowed in some regions due to funding constraints from state and local governments.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2013|7|Reports from financial institutions indicated that loan demand continued to increase. Contacts noted an uptick in applicants seeking residential construction loans and commercial office building mortgages. In line with reports of an improved outlook for business investment, banking contacts indicated that some firms have recently expanded their borrowing in order to invest in long-deferred expansion and capital improvement plans. Although banking contacts highlighted generally stiff competition for well-qualified business borrowers, they also noted more lending opportunities. However, hiring plans were mixed, with some financial institutions expecting to expand their payrolls significantly and others mentioning possible layoffs. In the District's Internet and digital media sectors, mergers and acquisitions activity stepped up in recent months. However, the pace of initial public offerings remained slow, and both venture capital and private equity activity were relatively weak.
boston|Retail and Tourism|2013|7|Retailers contacted for this round report year-over-year comp-store sales increases ranging between 1 percent and 5 percent. One contact had a low single digit decrease, but notes that sales trends have been improving. Demand is strong for all apparel categories, furniture, sporting goods, and mobile technology. Consumer sentiment continues to pick up, albeit very slowly, and prices at the wholesale and retail levels remain steady. All of the contacts expect continued slow-growth of the U.S. economy.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2013|7|Most of the 13 manufacturers contacted in this round report modest increases in sales. The one firm to report a significant decline in sales, a manufacturer of electric motors and brakes, could not pinpoint any specific reason for the weakness. Europe remains a source of weakness and China continues to inject volatility for manufacturing exports. One contact reports that sales in China of its products going into new commercial construction were up 46 percent in the second quarter. Only one contact, a manufacturer of textile and printing equipment, specifically mentions the evolving macroeconomic policy picture as an issue, saying that everything depends on what happens to interest rates. All but one of our contacts say that their outlook is for stable or higher sales going forward, but none report having raised their forecasts in the recent months.
boston|Selected Business Services|2013|7|Consulting and advertising contacts in the First District report a generally positive, but not exuberant, second quarter. Economic consulting has experienced very strong demand due to growth of high-stakes litigation. Healthcare and pharmaceuticals consulting contacts gave mixed reports, with several contacts reporting robust demand for services related to process efficiency, effectiveness analytics and marketing support, while another reports a slowdown in IT adoption. Strategy consultants had mixed results, with large firms faring better than smaller firms, largely due to greater exposure to the recently booming private equity industry. Marketing and advertising contacts report a slight uptick in growth from an already strong first quarter. Finally, a government contractor reports flat revenue.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2013|7|Commercial real estate markets in the First District are, for the most part, maintaining a solid footing. In Boston, rents on prime retail properties continue to climb and office rents are described as steady or rising, depending on location. Office leasing volume is holding steady in Hartford, although deals consist largely of short-term lease extensions with no expansion of space needs. Also in the Hartford area, investment sales demand remains strong for multifamily structures, while well-leased office buildings garner growing investor interest. In Providence, office leasing negotiations proceeded slowly as some tenants pushed back against landlords' rising rent demands, and some office sales fell through or stalled in response to June's spike in long-term Treasury rates. Also in response to the latter development, a regional banking contact reports that borrowing rates were raised on some commercial mortgages under negotiation and, moving forward, 10-year fixed-rate loans are likely to become more scarce. However, a Boston contact reports that borrowing rates and capitalization rates on commercial properties held largely steady in recent weeks.
boston|Residential Real Estate|2013|7|Single-family home and condominium sales rose throughout the First District in May. Contacts in the region report strong demand for housing, particularly in urban areas of New England. According to contacts, slight increases in interest rates will likely spur more buyer activity in the short term as households try to lock in historically low interest rates. In Massachusetts, particularly in the Greater Boston area, inventory levels remain low, placing upward pressure on prices. Contacts in the Greater Boston area caution that inventory remains the most significant constraint on sales growth. In other parts of the First District, smaller cities report depleting inventory levels in urban centers, though realtors in these areas feel that a sufficient number of homes are available to satisfy prospective buyers. In contrast to much of the region, Rhode Island maintains a high level of inventory, but that market appears to be recovering as sales activity and prices continue to increase.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|7|Consumer spending increased modestly. A Minnesota-based bar and restaurant chain noted that sales were up moderately during May and June compared with a year ago. A mall manager in North Dakota reported that sales increased modestly while traffic decreased slightly during late May and June; apparel sales were particularly slow. Meanwhile, a Minnesota-based apparel retailer recently reported strong gains in same-store sales. Minnesota vehicle sales were up from a year ago during May and June with truck sales particularly strong, according to a representative of an auto dealers association.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2013|7|Commercial construction activity continued to increase since the last report. The value of June commercial permits in Billings, Mont., increased significantly from last year, while hotel building rose to $6 million in June compared with zero in the first six months of 2012. A manager of an industrial real estate company noted increased interest in building warehouses on speculation because some purchase prices for existing structures are higher than the cost of building new. Several national retailers are opening new stores this year in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. However, in Sioux Falls, S.D., the value of June permits was down from a year ago. Residential construction increased at a fast pace over past year. The value of June single-family residential building permits in Billings was up 28 percent from last year; multifamily building also increased significantly. The value of June residential permits in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was up by 19 percent from June of 2012, while it fell in Sioux Falls.
minneapolis|Services|2013|7|Activity at professional business services firms increased since the last report. In Minneapolis, a technology consulting firm reported a recent expansion and an intellectual property protection firm is expanding. A lawyer at a Minnesota-based firm noted an uptick in corporate legal work.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2013|7|The District manufacturing sector continued to expand since the last report. A June survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that more manufacturing firms increased activity in Minnesota and the Dakotas than in previous months. An electronic equipment producer is moving forward on a plant in Minnesota. Another Minnesota firm that makes cable for utilities and telecommunications companies reported strong sales during the past few months. Several contacts in the metal forming business reported that they were having very strong years, with a few reporting their best year ever. A firm that supplies capital equipment to that industry is seeing strong demand; the auto sector was a particular source of strength.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2013|7|Activity in the energy sector increased moderately, while mining activity was sluggish. Late-June oil and gas exploration activity increased slightly in North Dakota from the last report and was flat in Montana. A Minnesota utility announced plans for $1.8 billion in upgrades to existing nuclear power plants. Recent output at District iron ore mines was below year-earlier levels. However, development will resume on a stalled copper-nickel mine project in the Upper Peninsula after the mine was sold to another company.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2013|7|The agricultural sector weakened since the last report. District farmers made progress after a late spring, but remain behind the five-year average for corn and soybean plantings due to recent heavy rains. In some areas, farmers are expected to switch from corn to soybeans due to the weather. Prices increased from a year earlier for wheat, corn, soybeans, chickens, milk, hogs, cattle and eggs; prices fell for turkeys and dry beans. The late plantings, along with concerns about warmer and drier weather later this summer, caused the USDA to increase its corn price forecast slightly, though prices are still expected to decrease from current levels.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|7|Labor markets continued to tighten slightly. In North Dakota, a health care administrative services firm plans to hire 375 new employees by September. A wind tower manufacturer recently announced plans to hire 250 workers in South Dakota when site construction is completed next year. A pipeline company plans to add 110 jobs in Minnesota. May Minnesota unemployment insurance claims were down 2 percent from a year earlier; data in recent months have averaged close to prerecession levels. However, a cellular phone company recently announced plans to lay off 50 employees at a plant in North Dakota. A software distributor announced plans to move its corporate headquarters out of Minnesota, eliminating 150 jobs in the state. In May, federal government employment in Minnesota was at its lowest level in more than 20 years, while state government employment was at its lowest level since January 2008.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2013|7|Reports from District factories indicated that new orders and production were largely stable or increased during the past six weeks. Companies seeing the strongest activity were suppliers to the residential construction and transportation industries. Compared to a year ago, production levels were mixed. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volumes were little changed. Our contacts expressed concern about downward pressure on domestic steel prices, which they attributed to rising imports. Motor vehicle production at District plants held steady during May on a month-over-month basis. Compared to a year ago, auto production rose slightly. Many of our contacts believe that demand will soften during the next couple of months, although part of the expected decline was attributed to seasonal factors. In response, there was some reduction in finished goods inventories.

In response, there was some reduction in finished goods inventories.
cleveland|Real Estate|2013|7|Sales of new single-family homes were down slightly in June when compared to earlier in the spring, although they remain above year-ago levels. Construction starts also fell slightly. One contractor commented that the recent decline in sales is not abnormal for this time of year. Traffic and inquiries were described as much better relative to last year. New home contracts were found mostly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories. Demand for multifamily housing was strong. Builders were confident that the turnaround in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months. Nonetheless, they cited difficulty in obtaining financing and a lack of buildable lots as barriers to more robust growth. List prices of new homes increased by as much as 5 percent in certain markets this year due primarily to rising costs for land, building materials, and to a lesser extent, labor. Home builders have cut back on discounting. Sale prices of existing single-family homes continued to rise across the District on a year-over-year basis, but the rate of increase is somewhat lower than the national average.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2013|7|Retailers described May sales as lackluster and noted that they fell below plan. However, sales were fairly even with the same month a year ago. Some of our contacts cited poor weather conditions for holding down consumer spending. Looking ahead, third-quarter sales are expected to be modestly higher when compared to those in the second quarter. A few contacts reported that their inventories were slightly higher than desired. Vendor and shelf prices held steady. Capital expenditures were on plan for the fiscal year. Monies are allocated primarily for store improvements and expansions. No hiring is anticipated, except for staffing new stores.
cleveland|Banking|2013|7|Demand for commercial real estate and multi family construction loans has picked up since our last report, while requests for other business loan categories were little changed. Almost all bankers reported aggressive credit-pricing pressure. Consumer credit demand rose slightly, especially for auto loans and home equity products. Residential mortgage activity remains relatively strong. Several bankers attributed a decline in refinancing to a rise in interest rates. New purchase mortgages are trending higher. No changes were made to loan-application standards. Aggregate core deposits grew at a steady pace, with a movement from CDs to demand deposits still taking place. There were a few reports about workforce reductions and shifting personnel as a means of cutting costs.
cleveland|Energy|2013|7|District coal production remains below year-ago levels, although the downward trend seen during the first five months of 2013 was showing signs of leveling off. Producers reported that demand from domestic utility companies is up slightly, while offshore demand is slowing (Asia) or stagnant (Europe). Spot prices for steam-coal rose slightly, whereas metallurgical coal prices were flat. The number of drilling rigs across the District has fallen significantly since the beginning of the year; however, the state of Ohio continued to issue shale gas drilling permits at a robust pace. Output from conventional and unconventional gas wells was stable during the past couple of months, while oil production picked up slightly. Well-head prices were little changed. Capital expenditures remain at targeted levels. On balance, little change was seen in production equipment and material prices.  payrolls and labor costs were flat.
cleveland|Freight Transportation|2013|7|Our contacts reported that shipping volume remains higher than expected, but the rate of growth has slowed since our last report. Freight executives are positive, but cautious about growth prospects for the near term. Of particular concern is how the new hours of service regulations (HOS) that went into effect on July 1 will play out. Our contacts believe that the primary impact of HOS will be on the availability of drivers and the ability of shipping companies to effectively schedule those drivers. Potential reductions in capacity will tend to drive up shipping costs. Prices for equipment and maintenance items were stable. Capital spending is on plan for the fiscal year. Monies are used mainly for tractor/trailer replacement and capacity expansion. The industry is still experiencing a shortage of drivers and skilled mechanics. The former may worsen under the new HOS regulations.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|7|Reports from District retailers were mixed. While most merchants experienced modest growth, growth was lower than expected in some cases. Some attributed lackluster sales to weather conditions. Auto dealers continued to experience strong growth.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2013|7|District brokers continued to report that existing home sales remained ahead of last year's level were mostly ahead of expectations. However, brokers still report that inventories remain at low levels, and thereby restraining sales. Shortages were also said to be putting upward pressure on home prices. Existing home prices continued to rise on a year-over-year basis. The outlook for sales growth remained positive, with the majority of brokers anticipating sales gains over the next several months.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2013|7|Regional manufacturers reported expanding activity; however, the rate of growth slowed as a result of a decrease in new orders, production, and finished inventory. Contacts reported a slight decline in commodities prices and some expressed that inventories may build in some sectors as manufacturers take advantage of favorable prices. Less than half of purchasing managers expect production to be higher in the next three to six months, slightly lower than our previous report.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2013|7|Some institutions reported a pickup in mortgage loan demand attributed to improved housing markets and increasing interest rates. They also indicated that while mortgage refinancing had slowed, new purchase loan demand had increased. Demand for automobile loans declined as banks and credit unions noted they could not compete with zero percent deals from auto manufacturers.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2013|7|Since the last report, District payrolls grew at a modest pace. Tennessee experienced moderate payroll gains in retail, trade and transportation, professional and business services, and manufacturing. Alabama continued to see hiring in hospitality services, most notably in accommodation and food services. Louisiana added jobs in construction, and education and healthcare. All District states saw payroll contractions in their government sectors, with the exception of Mississippi, which showed a mild gain at the state government level.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2013|7|Regional oil and gas activity remained robust. Significant capital investment continued in liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities along the Gulf Coast. Expansion projects on existing refineries were noted as moving along, marking the first time such investments have been made in twenty years. There were some comments that high costs to transport oil and gas by rail, barge, and truck were exerting upward pressure on prices for refined products. Contacts also indicated that capacity for oil and natural gas products remained abundant and that domestic demand for energy products was beginning to rise for the season.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2013|7|Retailers report that sales softened in May and especially in June. One major retail chain reports that same-store sales were little changed from a year earlier, running modestly below plan in May and noticeably below plan in June. Another chain indicates that sales were down noticeably from 2012 levels in both months. In general, New York City stores performed a bit better than those elsewhere in the District--likely buoyed by tourism. Major malls in upstate New York indicate that sales were steady to lower than a year earlier. Most of the retail contacts attribute at least part of the recent softness in sales to unseasonably cold and wet weather. Inventories are generally reported to be at desired levels or a little on the high side. Prices are characterized as steady, and no unusual discounting is reported.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2013|7|Residential real estate markets in the District have strengthened further since the last report. Sales prices for Manhattan apartments (co-ops and condos) were up moderately from a year earlier, while sales volume was up nearly 20 percent, further sharply reducing the inventory of units on the market. Rents on Manhattan apartments continue to rise and are running roughly 5 percent ahead of comparable 2012 levels, however, rents have slipped modestly in Brooklyn. New Jerseys housing market has shown more modest signs of improvement: prices are rising slowly, reportedly restrained by an ongoing backlog of distressed properties on the market. However, new construction activity--particularly of rental apartment buildings--is running substantially ahead of a year ago. Finally, housing market conditions remain particularly strong in western New York State: very tight inventory levels have pushed prices up, and multiple offers and bidding wars have become commonplace, despite continued tight lending standards.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2013|7|The labor market continues to improve at a gradual pace. Two major employment agencies describe market fundamentals as favorable but note that the market is difficult to gauge at this typically slow time of year. One contact notes increasing difficulty in finding candidates with specific skill sets--especially for technology workers--and also finds companies becoming less reluctant to negotiate on salaries. This is described as the best year for college graduates since 2008.
new_york|Financial Developments|2013|7|Bankers report increased demand for commercial mortgages but decreased demand for residential mortgages. For other loan categories, as well as for refinancing, contacts report no change in demand. Respondents also note that credit standards remain unchanged across all loan categories. Bankers indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly in commercial mortgages. Finally, bankers report decreased delinquency rates for all loan categories, but especially for commercial & industrial loans.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2013|7|Growth in consumer spending increased in June. Contacts attributed the pick-up in the pace of growth to recent gains in consumer confidence, an increase in auto dealer incentives and other retail promotions, and the rebounding housing market. Auto sales increased at a faster rate than non-auto retail sales. Auto dealers reported strong sales of both pick-up trucks and small passenger cars, as well as an increase in activity in the leasing market. For non-auto retail sales, contacts noted that high-end retailers and discount stores both continued to fare better than middle market retailers.
chicago|Business Spending|2013|7|Growth in business spending also picked up in June. Spending on equipment and software increased slightly, as did spending on structures. A few contacts reported an increase in merger and acquisitions activity, but noted that deals were being delayed by uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. Inventory investment was also impacted by elevated uncertainty. Retail contacts reported that inventories remained tight, as many retailers were planning to wait until after the back-to-school season to re-assess the state of demand and before placing the bulk of their holiday orders. Manufacturers were also limiting inventory investment, with a contact noting that steel service centers were liquidating inventories given weak demand. Labor market conditions continued to improve slowly. Demand for skilled workers remained relatively stronger, particularly for healthcare, information technology, engineering, and other technical occupations. Manufacturing contacts, however, were generally more cautious in their hiring plans, with some layoffs reported in industries where activity has slowed considerably in recent months. In addition, several retailers reported that the Affordable Care Act would lead to more part-time and temporary versus full-time hiring.
chicago|Construction and Real Sstate|2013|7|Construction and real estate activity continued to increase gradually in June. Demand for residential construction grew steadily, as multifamily construction remained strong and single-family construction continued to improve. A homebuilder noted that while new single-family development remained limited, improvement of vacant lots in existing developments was increasing. Activity in the residential real estate market continued to increase as well, with home sales, prices, and rents rising. Nonresidential construction grew at a modest pace, driven in large part by the ongoing expansion of the auto industry. However, a contact noted that planned upgrades to auto supplier facilities were nearly complete; and that with auto production getting back to pre-recession levels, any additional capacity expansion was likely to be incremental. Commercial real estate conditions continued to improve as rents rose slowly and vacancies fell.
chicago|Manufacturing|2013|7|production increased in June. The auto industry continued to be a source of strength, with the traditional summer shut-down period scaled back this year to meet the increase in customer demand. Vehicle demand was strong across all sectors, and auto industry contacts reported growing confidence that activity will remain robust in the second half of the year. Steel production again grew at a moderate pace, and specialty metal manufacturers reported a modest improvement in new orders and order backlogs. In contrast, demand for heavy equipment remained soft, although contacts anticipated a slight improvement in the remaining months of the year. Mining activity continued to weaken, and contacts expressed concern over the effect environmental regulations would have on the coal mining industry moving forward. Demand for construction equipment picked up some as the housing market continued to improve.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2013|7|Credit conditions tightened moderately over the reporting period. Volatility increased across a number of asset classes and corporate borrowing costs rose. Financial market participants noted lower activity in fixed income markets, particularly the high-yield corporate debt market. Banking contacts cited less demand among their larger clients for leveraged financing, and continued uneven growth in the middle market driven mostly by refinancing of existing debt. Credit standards remained roughly unchanged, although contacts reported additional downward pressure on pricing. In contrast, consumer loan demand increased over the reporting period, particularly for auto lending. With the recent increase in mortgage rates, mortgage refinancing slowed, but contacts again noted an increase in new mortgage originations.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2013|7|Cost pressures remained mild in June. Commodity prices continued to trend lower, although some contacts noted increases in the prices paid for concrete, drywall, metals such as steel and copper, and energy goods and services. Retailers again reported mostly modest increases in wholesale prices; and, overall, pass-through to downstream prices was limited. Wage pressures remained moderate, although many contacts again noted rising healthcare and other benefit costs. Some of these higher costs were being passed on to employees.
chicago|Agriculture|2013|7|Crop conditions improved over the course of the reporting period, with the crop ending the period in better shape than a year ago. District farmers managed to get their crops in the ground despite additional planting delays caused by the unseasonably wet weather. Only a small percentage of acres will not grow a crop, where water pooled in low-lying areas and replanting was not possible. Fruit crops could produce record yields this year, in sharp contrast with the large losses seen a year ago. With stocks of corn and soybeans expected to remain at very low levels until the fall harvest, corn and soybean prices moved higher. The increase in feed costs negatively affected livestock operations, and contacts noted that it would lead to careful management of feed purchases until anticipated declines in crop prices are likely to materialize following a potentially record fall harvest. The first cutting of hay was mostly complete and was much better than last year. Supported by rejuvenated pastures, milk output also increased. Milk prices were roughly unchanged during the reporting period, while hog prices surged, and cattle prices were lower.
dallas|Prices|2013|7|Most responding firms said prices were stable, although there were some reports of increases. Airline ticket prices rose slightly because of summer demand, and transportation service firms expect shipping rates to increase due to a recent upturn in jet fuel prices. Home prices rose rapidly as demand continued to outstrip supply. Financial institutions reported a notable rise in mortgage rates. Accounting contacts said billing rates stabilized after earlier increases were successfully implemented. Retail prices were unchanged since the last report.
dallas|Labor Market|2013|7|Employment held steady at most responding firms, although there were more reports of hiring than at the time of the last report. Nominal employment increases were reported by retailers, and hiring was noted by some primary metals and cement manufacturers. Accounting and legal firms continued to add workers in selected business areas. A railroad contact reported employment growth, but the hiring was concentrated outside the Eleventh District. Difficulty finding qualified workers became more widespread, with scattered reports among accounting, finance, single-family construction, auto sales, and primary metals manufacturing firms, as well as from retailers in the Eagle Ford Shale area.
dallas|Manufacturing|2013|7|activity improved slightly over the reporting period. Construction-related manufacturers said demand was flat or up, and a cement producer noted very strong demand from residential construction, allowing the company to choose which projects to take on. Outlooks were more optimistic than in prior periods. Primary metals manufacturers said demand held steady at strong levels, although there wasnt much enthusiasm regarding the remainder of the year. An exception was commercial construction-related demand, which is expected to pick up. Fabricated metals firms noted improved demand and positive outlooks.
dallas|Retail Sales|2013|7|Retail sales volumes held steady over the reporting period and were up from a year ago. Outlooks for the rest of the year were positive, with growth expected to continue at about the same pace as in the first half.
dallas|Nonfinancial Services|2013|7|Most nonfinancial services firms noted increased demand since the last report, although staffing services contacts offered mixed reports: high-level IT workers and engineering project managers were in high demand, while demand weakened for lower-skilled positions. One staffing services firm saw more placements at the end of the quarter than usual. Accounting firms reported a strong increase in demand since the last Beige Book, led by transactions work. There was a good backlog of work, so contacts are expecting a strong third quarter. Legal firms noted modest demand growth, but work was down year-over-year on a per-lawyer basis. Real estate work continued to rise, although lawyers became somewhat concerned about interest rate risk. Contacts noted a lack of litigation work, and demand for energy work experienced a little softness although it remained strong. Firms expect to see improvement on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.
dallas|Construction and Real Estate|2013|7|Activity in the housing sector continued to grow at a strong pace over the reporting period. Single-family home sales continued to outpace supply, leading to very low inventories and rapid price increases. Building activity picked up but was not yet able to meet demand in the major metro areas. Slightly higher mortgage rates are not expected to derail demand, according to most contacts. Apartment demand remained at high levels. Apartment construction rose in the major metros, where occupancies were above 90 percent.
dallas|Financial Services|2013|7|Financial institutions experienced moderate growth in loan demand. Commercial real estate and transactions lending increased solidly, especially in oil and gas areas around the Eagle Ford Shale and West Texas. Demand for auto loans grew strongly. Loan quality was good and continued to improve, and borrowers were still paying down debt rapidly. Loan pricing remained extremely competitive, and community banks were often outbid by regional banks. Mortgage rates rose in June. Deposits and deposit rates were flat to slightly down. The outlook for loan demand is optimistic, with a robust pipeline for mortgages.
dallas|Energy|2013|7|activity was little changed at high levels. Global demand held steady, although there was some weakness from Mexico and Canada. Respondents expect improvement in energy activity in the second half of the year, due in part to anticipated increases in rig activity and production from the Gulf of Mexico.
dallas|Agriculture|2013|7|Much of the Eleventh District remained in severe drought, with conditions little changed from the last reporting period. Row crop farmers completed planting, and crop conditions were mostly fair to good, according to respondents. The wheat harvest continued, but production was sharply reduced as a very large share of the acres planted was abandoned because of drought and freeze damage. Livestock feedlots and meat processors continued to suffer greatly from high feed costs and a shrinking cattle herd.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|7|Reports of manufacturing activity plans have been positive since our previous report. Several manufacturing firms reported significant plans to add workers, expand operations, or open new facilities in the Eighth District, while a smaller number of manufacturers reported plans to reduce their employee count. Firms in automobile, automobile parts, lumber, bakery, petroleum refining, and firearm manufacturing plan to hire new employees and expand operations in the Eighth District. In contrast, firms that manufacture boats, housewares, turbines, and medical equipment reported plans to lay off workers in the District.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2013|7|Home sales have continued to increase throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2012, May 2013 year-to-date home sales were up 17 percent in Louisville, 24 percent in Little Rock, 8 percent in Memphis, and 14 percent in St. Louis. May 2013 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2012. Permits increased 18 percent in Louisville, 23 percent in Memphis, and 18 percent in St. Louis. Permits decreased 3 percent in Little Rock.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2013|7|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and midsized District banks increased 1.8 percent from mid-March to mid-June. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.4 percent of total loans, increased 0.9 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.7 percent of total loans, increased 0.7 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of total loans, increased 1.9 percent. All other loans, accounting for 6.2 percent of total loans, increased 15.3 percent. During this period, total deposits at these banks decreased 0.8 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|7|At the end of June, the condition of over 90 percent of the cotton, corn, soybeans, sorghum, and rice crops was rated as fair or better in all the District states. Furthermore, at least 70 percent of total pastureland across the District states was rated in good or excellent condition. The winter wheat harvest was behind its 5-year average and behind the progress made by the same time last year. Year-to-date coal production for the District states at the end of May was lower than the same period last year because of lackluster production in Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, and Indiana. In contrast, year-to-date coal production in Arkansas was 55 percent higher than the same period last year.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2013|7|Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported that orders and shipments are rising again. The makers of paper products, rubber products, fabricated metals, industrial machinery, and instruments have reported gains since the last Beige Book. Firms supplying the home-building sector continued to report strong orders and ongoing hiring to keep pace. The makers of food products and electronic equipment reported lower activity (some was seasonal). Reports were mixed for makers of primary metals. Other contacts attributed growing demand to auto-related business and foreign demand. A negative impact from sequestration was cited by some firms, while others said they avoided the worst effects. Firms continued to report restraint in current hiring but a desire to hire more workers in the near future.
philadelphia|Retail|2013|7|Third District retailers have reported modest growth--dampened by rainy weather--since the last Beige Book. Contacts described June and July as seasonally slower months, as local residents head off for summer vacations. However, excessive rain in June kept still more people away from stores, while some showed up just to "hang out" at the mall. Mall operators reported that the general retail climate has improved, citing stronger demand for retail space and rising occupancy rates.
philadelphia|Finance|2013|7|Overall, Third District financial firms reported modest increases in total loan volume--a slight improvement since the previous Beige Book. Banking contacts cited stronger demand for all major loan categories, including C&I loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans, including credit cards. Consumer lending and home equity loans remained slow, as refinancings remained a preferred option for homeowners. However, contacts reported a decline in refinance applications in the pipeline after rates rose. Meanwhile, increasing sales of new and existing homes are raising demand for home mortgages. Banking contacts continued to report strong competition for loans and concerns about competitors lowering their lending standards. However, most banks reported "improvement in all aspects of business," including "more upgrades of credits" within their own portfolios. Contacts expressed continued optimism for future growth and sensed greater customer confidence.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2013|7|Homebuilders throughout most of the Third District continued to report moderate growth. Though traffic and sales were soft in a few markets, most builders are meeting their plan for the year with increases as high as 40 percent. Builders reported no systemic impediments to sales, such as credit availability and mortgage issues. Some builders still face labor shortages for carpentry and framing work, and several contacts have reported a shortage of finished land. Moderate growth of existing home sales continued through June, according to residential brokers. Sales closed and sales pending grew by double digits (year over year) in several larger metropolitan areas in the Third District.  The estimated months' supply of the existing inventory of homes has fallen to near six months in many areas. Brokers say the anticipated shadow inventory of homes has not yet emerged.
philadelphia|Services|2013|7|Third District service-sector firms continued to report a moderate pace of growth overall. Despite earlier strong bookings, shore destinations in Delaware and New Jersey reported somewhat lower activity (traffic counts, bookings, and boardwalk sales) and cited rainy weather through much of June as one source of the problem. A multimillion dollar advertising campaign has helped boost Jersey Shore activity, but tourism in the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Sandy is still down somewhat more than is necessitated by the actual damage. Casino revenues from Atlantic City and the state of Delaware remain on a downward trend, and reports from Pennsylvania casinos indicate that revenue from slot machines appears to be turning in the same direction.
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2013|7|Overall, price levels continued to increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Manufacturing firms reported modest increases for prices paid and prices received. Auto dealers reported no changes in pricing. Homebuilders continued to face tight margins and higher prices for some skilled labor. Most real estate contacts reported stable, if not rising, prices for lower priced homes, and contacts in some markets noted stable prices for higher-priced homes. Contacts from retail, restaurants, and some services indicated that commodity prices have not been a big issue this year as in the recent past. Wage pressures remain constrained, according to most contacts other than homebuilders.
summary|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|7|Manufacturing increased in most Districts since the previous survey. The exception was Kansas City, which noted a slight contraction, with storms retarding some activity. Most Districts reported stable or increasing new orders, shipments, and production. Reports from contacts in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts indicated moderate growth in manufacturing. The Minneapolis District further noted that more manufacturing firms increased activity than in the previous report; the Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts noted that the uptick was modest; and the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts noted slight improvements. Firms in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts were broadly optimistic about prospects for the second half of 2013, while manufacturers in the Richmond District were cautiously optimistic; contacts expressed mixed outlooks in the Dallas District, and contacts in the Cleveland and Atlanta District do not expect future production to be as high as previously projected.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2013|7|Most Districts noted that overall consumer spending increased during the reporting period. Reports from the Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts indicated modest or moderate growth in retail spending, while reports from the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts indicated steady to slightly higher sales. The New York District noted that retail sales in May and June had softened. Retailers in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts reported that sales had not met expectations. Contacts in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts also noted that weather conditions constrained retail activity. Demand for tech products was strong or increased in the Boston and San Francisco Districts. The Kansas City District reported that appliance purchases were slow, while the Richmond District reported that big ticket item sales were high. Inventories were at desired levels or slightly high in the New York and Cleveland Districts, and remained tight in the Chicago District. The outlook among retailers was positive in the Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts and cautiously optimistic in the St. Louis District.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2013|7|Residential real estate activity increased at a moderate to strong pace in most Districts. Most Districts reported increases in home sales. Cleveland noted that June sales of single-family homes were down compared with earlier in the spring but up from last year. Boston, New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted strong residential real estate markets. Home prices increased throughout the majority of the reporting Districts. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas noted low or declining home inventories and upward pressures on home prices in some areas. Residential construction activity also improved moderately across the Districts, and contacts in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported faster growth in multi-family construction, in particular.
summary|Banking and Finance|2013|7|Reports on banking conditions were generally positive across the Districts. Overall loan demand increased modestly across most reporting Districts. New York District bankers reported mixed but generally steady loan demand. Some bankers in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts noted competitive pressures to reduce loan pricing. Bankers in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts noted a shift toward new home mortgages and away from refinancing (which was led, in part, by increases in interest rates).
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resource Industries|2013|7|Agricultural conditions varied across the Districts because of differing weather conditions. Crop conditions improved in the Chicago and St. Louis Districts, while agricultural production increased in the San Francisco District and is expected to improve in the Kansas City District. Extremely wet conditions delayed planting and even resulted in some farmers in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts planting soybeans instead of corn. Excessive rains in the Richmond District also damaged the wheat crop in some areas. Contacts noted persistent drought conditions in some areas of the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts and in most of the Dallas District. Winter wheat harvest output yields were highly variable because of crop damage from freezing and drought in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. The condition of pastureland in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts improved since the previous report.
summary|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2013|7|Hiring held steady or increased at a measured pace in most Districts. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts were cautious or reluctant to hire permanent or full-time staff. The Richmond and Chicago Districts noted relatively stronger demand for part-time workers. Transportation contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noted some difficulty finding qualified drivers. Contacts in the New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts reported high demand for technology workers.
richmond|Manufacturing|2013|7|Manufacturers expressed cautious optimism in the weeks since our last report, as activity in that sector strengthened modestly. Shipments and new orders rose, and the average workweek increased. Despite the improved conditions, producers preferred to use cash to update technology and existing infrastructure, rather than undertake expansion. A plastics manufacturer commented that his company was purchasing new machinery in response to increased work levels, and he saw industrial confidence as being up, but still cautious. A lumber company executive said he will not hire new full-time employees until next year, but that, so far, this has been his best year since 2007. Moreover, according to a representative of several manufacturers, some firms have gone to two shifts and further growth is expected for the second half of this year as backlogs build. Even so, he described confidence as "fragile, and nobody takes it for granted." Federal spending reductions, tax changes, and slower overseas demand affected some manufacturers. A manufacturer of packaging materials commented, "There is a light at the end of the tunnel, but it only flickers at times." Price growth increased for raw materials and finished goods, according to our latest survey of manufacturers.
richmond|Ports|2013|7|Port volumes were little changed overall in recent weeks. Lumber imports picked up, while imports of auto parts and auto assembly inputs softened slightly from very high volumes. Imports and exports of autos remained strong. Exports of containerized agricultural products rose, particularly logs and animal feed inputs, while exports of wheat sprouts declined. Energy-related exports and agricultural equipment were solid, with agricultural equipment peaking in late spring as usual, albeit somewhat below year-ago record levels. Overall, coal exports were unchanged. Port administrators expected seasonal increases in the weeks ahead for back-to-school and holiday imports.
richmond|Retail|2013|7|sales strengthened slightly in recent weeks, helped by big-ticket sales. A wholesaler of heavy construction equipment commented that his firm had seen significant improvement. Additionally, a contact at a large auto and light truck dealership remarked that sales volume was strong and the market was extremely competitive. He noted that new vehicle sales were being driven by full-size pickups that are typically purchased by homebuilders and construction-related services businesses. Used car sales were exceptionally strong and some dealers had shortages of used vehicles. A report from a large department store chain said that cold and damp weather, along with the payroll tax change, had constrained sales.  price growth slowed since our last report.
richmond|Services|2013|7|Non-retail services firms reported steady to stronger activity. Telecommunications firms, accountants, and a firm specializing in software design for clinical use reported rising revenues. Hospital consolidation remained "intense," according to a contact in North Carolina. Non-retail prices rose more slowly in this reporting period.
richmond|Finance|2013|7|Banking activity increased slightly since our last assessment. Demand for residential mortgages was up in most markets and bankers across the Fifth District commented that there had been a noticeable shift toward new purchases and away from refinancing. A Virginia banker proclaimed that "refinancing had died," although a lender in South Carolina said that refinancing still made up the majority of his residential mortgage business. However, some customers no longer qualified for loan refinancing due to higher rates. Similarly, "the phone rang more often" for a Virginia banker while a lender in Maryland reported that people were waiting to see what rates would do. Demand for residential construction loans rose in South Carolina. Commercial and industrial loan demand was flat to slightly higher. There were several loans in the pipeline at a West Virginia bank, most of which were for new structures (i.e., office buildings, car showrooms, and a retirement community). However, higher interest rates caused some deals to be reevaluated and put on hold or pulled. Contacts also stated that clients were surprised at the higher rates and that businesses were trying to figure out how best to budget for them.
richmond|Real Estate|2013|7|Residential real estate sales expanded. Two Washington, D.C. area agents reported that it was now routine to see multiple offers for a home, as well as escalator clauses in those contracts. Another contact in the region said that home repair and specialized construction were benefitting from strength in the housing market. Due in part to its proximity to D.C. and Baltimore, home sales in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia finally saw some improvement. In addition, home sales in western North Carolina were up, causing inventories to erode and speculative building to resume. Inventories were also low in the Charlotte region where home sales and prices had both increased. Lastly, a source on the eastern shore of Maryland stated that appraisals were below the sales price of homes in some areas.
richmond|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2013|7|Recent reports on agricultural conditions were mixed. While a South Carolina farm loan banker reported that the wet weather earlier in the year "started the crop season off in a positive light," other reports from South Carolina and Virginia indicated that the rains delayed planting and even resulted in one farmer planting soybeans and cotton instead of corn. In addition, a South Carolina contact noted that heavy rains had damaged the regional wheat crop to the extent that sprouts were unacceptable for export. A North Carolina source also noted a recent shift to cotton over corn, due to declining corn prices. Nevertheless, another source remarked that agricultural lending was "booming" and demand for wood products continued to rise.
richmond|Labor Markets|2013|7|Conditions in the District labor market were somewhat better since our last report. Employment rose in several industries, including home repair and construction, hotels, and medical software. In addition, a contact from a temp agency in North Carolina reported there was high demand for technology professionals, particularly for healthcare-related IT, as well as accounting, finance, and real estate. He added that contingent labor was in much greater demand than full-time employees due to uncertainty about the economy; another source said that small businesses were going out of their way to avoid the long-term commitment of permanent hiring. In contrast, a web consulting firm in Virginia and a social assistance organization in North Carolina planned to add employees. Also, a staffing agency in South Carolina reported weak demand for labor, and two electrical equipment manufacturers laid off employees. According to our latest surveys, wage growth picked up in the manufacturing sector, remained robust at non-retail establishments, and flattened at retail businesses.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2013|7|Consumer spending edged up in June, with increased tourism and restaurant spending, but little change in automobile and retail sales. Contacts in most sectors expected consumer spending to improve over the next three months. District retail sales were flat over the survey period. Purchases of large ticket items, such as appliances, slowed relative to lower-priced goods. Tourism activity and hotel occupancy rates both rose relative to the last survey period, but were similar to levels a year ago. Average daily room rates were unchanged and were expected to remain the same in the coming months. Restaurant sales ticked up since the last survey, and respondents expected similar levels of activity over the next few months. Automobile dealers reported sales were steady and above year-ago levels, but inventories continued to increase. The majority of dealers still expected faster sales growth in the coming months.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2013|7|Manufacturing activity contracted slightly in June, while high-tech activity rose and transportation was flat. A number of factories reported production delays and shipment interruptions due to recent regional storms and flooding. Activity was especially weak among producers of food and machinery. However, expectations for future factory activity continued to increase. High-tech service firms reported that sales improved during the survey period, but activity was expected to be flat over the next three months. Transportation activity and capital expenditures were unchanged in June compared to the previous survey period. Transportation firms reported difficulty finding qualified drivers, and some anticipated increased costs due to compliance with the Affordable Care Act.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2013|7|Residential real estate activity remained robust, while commercial real estate activity ticked up in June. Residential real estate sales continued to rise. Prices continued on an upward trend while inventories were somewhat lower compared to the prior survey period. Contacts in some District markets reported that low inventories slowed sales and put upward pressure on prices. Views on the likely impact of rising interest rates were mixed. Some contacts expected that recent increases in mortgage rates would encourage more people to buy before rates increased further, while others anticipated a reduction in activity. Recent storm damage to homes in some parts of the District was also expected to add to the demand for housing in those areas. Residential builders reported solid construction activity, with expectations for further modest growth. Commercial real estate activity ticked up during the past month, as construction activity continued to strengthen. Sales prices held steady, and vacancy rates fell further in some areas. Contacts expected stronger activity in coming months, but several noted uncertainty around rising interest rates.
kansas_city|Banking|2013|7|Bankers reported slightly stronger overall loan demand, moderately improved loan quality, and slightly lower deposit levels. Respondents reported stable demand for commercial real estate and consumer installment loans. Demand for commercial and industrial loans increased, while demand for residential real estate loans declined. Nearly all bankers reported slight improvements in loan quality compared to a year ago. They also expected loan quality to marginally improve over the next six months. Credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories and respondents reported slightly lower deposits.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2013|7|Agricultural production expectations improved somewhat with recent rains, but varied regionally. Summer storms eased dry conditions in eastern parts of the District, though drought persisted in western regions. The winter wheat harvest was underway or complete in Oklahoma and Kansas with highly variable yields depending on the extent of drought and freeze damage. Despite expectations of a poor wheat harvest in some areas, wheat prices fell since the last survey period. The corn and soybean crops, however, were rated in mostly good or better condition with the improved soil moisture. Although corn and soybean prices remained historically high, improved growing conditions led to a drop in expected harvest prices for both crops. Feedlot operators struggled with high input costs and falling cattle prices, but losses narrowed for hog producers after a rebound in hog prices. Cropland values moved higher but were expected to hold steady during the growing season.
kansas_city|Energy|2013|7|District energy activity held steady over the survey period. Overall, drilling activity remained stable for both oil and natural gas in June. With oil prices elevated and natural gas prices low, drilling activity was expected to continue to shift away from natural gas to oil. However, energy contacts expected oil and natural gas drilling to accelerate over the next few months. Wyoming coal production was unchanged in June, but demand has weakened over the past year. Ethanol production continued to edge higher, and inventories trended down as profitability in the sector improved modestly.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2013|7|Wage pressures remained low during June, and prices were generally unchanged during the survey period. The percentage of firms reporting labor shortages increased slightly, but recent wage increases remained modest. Firms reported strong demand for long haul drivers, delivery drivers, skilled auto technicians and hotel housekeeping staff. Retail prices were steady during June, and retailers did not expect to raise prices over the next three months. Menu prices and food costs were flat during the survey period. Food costs were expected to rise over the next three months, but most restaurants did not anticipate passing the increases through to consumers. Raw material prices for manufacturers were unchanged in June, but expectations did move up moderately. Finished goods prices increased slightly, but manufacturers projected future finished goods prices would be lower. Construction supply firms and builders reported that prices for construction materials were unchanged and neither expected prices to rise over the next three months. Similarly, transportation firms responded that input prices were flat.
san_francisco|Wages and Prices|2011|1|Upward price pressures remained subdued on balance. Price increases were noted for assorted raw materials, such as cotton, copper, aluminum, and especially oil. However, final prices for most retail items and services continued to be held down by tepid demand and vigorous competition.
san_francisco|Retail Trade and Services|2011|1|Retail sales increased notably compared with the prior holiday season. Both traditional department stores and smaller specialty retailers reported that holiday sales exceeded their expectations, which were for modest growth. Moreover, tightly controlled inventories enabled many retailers to rely less heavily on price discounts and promotional activity than in the recent past. The pace of sales improved modestly for grocers compared with the prior reporting period, while it remained largely unchanged at a slow pace for retailers of furniture and major appliances. Demand for new automobiles continued to strengthen, particularly for light trucks. Demand for used vehicles was strong as well, and the resulting high trade-in values reportedly helped spur sales of new vehicles.
san_francisco|Manufacturing|2011|1|activity in the District continued to expand during the reporting period of late November through the end of December. Demand grew further for manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, with contacts noting balanced inventories and high levels of capacity utilization. Production rates remained at or near capacity for makers of commercial aircraft and parts, as an existing order backlog for larger aircraft was reinforced by rising orders for smaller commercial jets. Metal fabricators saw further increases in demand; sustained improvement has brought capacity utilization back near normal and prompted some firms to rehire employees laid-off over the past two years. Petroleum refiners continued to reduce their output and work down inventories, which have been at elevated levels in recent months. Conditions remained depressed for manufacturers of wood products.
san_francisco|Agriculture and Resource-related Industries|2011|1|Demand was solid for agricultural products, and activity was stable to up slightly for extractors of natural resources used for energy production. Orders and sales remained robust for a variety of crop and livestock products, especially cotton and cattle. Outside of price increases for livestock feed, reports indicated that input costs were generally stable. Demand for crude oil grew further, spurred by robust demand from emerging economies combined with modest growth in domestic demand. For natural gas, ample inventories kept extraction activity largely flat.
san_francisco|Real Estate and Construction|2011|1|Demand in District residential and commercial real estate markets was largely unchanged at very low levels. The pace of home sales remained quite slow throughout the District. In addition, an abundance of foreclosed properties and short sales kept inventories of available homes elevated in most areas, which put downward pressure on prices and the pace of new home construction. Demand for rental space grew in some areas, however, with a Seattle contact noting a modest increase in construction of apartment buildings there. Conditions continued to be weak on balance in commercial real estate markets, as vacancy rates stayed high in many parts of the District; rent reductions and other concessions by landlords remained common. In a positive sign, however, investor demand for well-leased office buildings continued to boost market values in some of the District's major commercial markets, such as San Francisco.
san_francisco|Financial Institutions|2011|1|Reports from District banking contacts indicated that loan demand was largely stable compared with the prior reporting period. Businesses continued to be cautious regarding capital spending, which held the volume of new commercial and industrial loans at low levels. However, contacts noted a slight uptick in utilization of existing lines of credit for businesses. Consumer loan demand remained weak overall, and contacts reported a significant decline in mortgage refinancing, which they largely attributed to the recent rise in long-term interest rates. Lending standards remained relatively restrictive for most types of consumer and business loans, although reports suggested modest ongoing improvements in overall credit quality. Venture capital financing was a bright spot, with contacts noting increased investor interest and funding for early-stage technology companies during the reporting period.
boston|Retail|2011|1|The majority of contacted First District retailers report positive sales results for the months of November and December. Year-over-year comparable same-store sales are mostly increases ranging from the low single digits to the low double digits, with the exception of one contact who reports a drop in same-store sales but notes a recent positive turn. Several retailers indicate that consumers continue to react positively to promotions. Sales of apparel, sporting goods, cameras, and other gift items were strong leading up to Christmas. Respondents generally are pleased with early holiday shopping results.
boston|Manufacturing and Related Services|2011|1|The majority of manufacturing firms surveyed continue to report relatively positive business conditions. The exceptions include one firm with exposure to the residential construction sector, whose business has been sluggish for an extended period, and a few others whose business tends to be a-cyclical. On the positive side, a small diversified manufacturer reports sales growth in the high single digits and notes that its revenues have returned to pre-recession levels. A company in the electronics business says that its sales growth in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of expectations, but is likely to be somewhat inconsistent going forward due to uncertainty about future large contracts. In addition, sales at a semi-conductor firm remain strong relative to 2009 and are on par with their strong results in third quarter 2010; a food products manufacturer also reports strong sales.
boston|Selected Business Services|2011|1|Advertising and consulting contacts in the First District report significant growth in demand during the fourth quarter of 2010, with increases in revenue ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent. Most contacts attribute the rise to pent-up demand across many sectors and industries, as clients have been restrained by economic conditions since 2008. Responding firms held their prices steady or increased them slightly in the fourth quarter; some are planning to raise prices about 5 percent in 2011. Changes in business costs vary, with some firms citing stable wages, some raising compensation, and one firm cutting costs by hiring lower wage-rate replacements for selected employees. All contacts plan to increase employment next year to meet recent and expected increases in demand, with net hiring of 5 percent to 20 percent. Some of them expect salaries to stay stable through 2011, while some expect modest increases.
boston|Commercial Real Estate|2011|1|New England's commercial real estate market was stable in recent weeks. In Boston, a steady volume of lease renewals generated significant revenue for brokers but resulted in little to no net absorption. For the year, office vacancy increased in greater Boston and, according to one contact, is currently in the high teens in the Financial District, while Back Bay and Cambridge enjoy much lower rates (below 10 percent). In Providence and Portland, modest positive absorption is cited in core downtown districts, as tenants are eager to sign deals to take advantage of low rental rates, which are not expected to persist much longer. In Hartford, the vacancy rate for downtown, class A office space was placed at 24 percent for the third quarter; there is some expectation that the city's office absorption rate will turn modestly positive in 2011. Construction remains limited across the region, with the exception of the multifamily sector, which continues to attract strong investor interest and very attractive financing terms. Based on recent sales prices, one Boston lender to commercial real estate is concerned that the city's multifamily market may be "overheating."
boston|Residential Real Estate|2011|1|Home and condo sales in the First District continued to show significant year-over-year declines in November, as many contacts had expected. Respondents say the large year-over-year declines throughout New England partially stem from the extra boost in activity observed in November 2009 when the first-time homebuyer tax credit was originally set to expire. Nonetheless, home and condo sales activity remains sluggish by any measure throughout the region, with all contacts anticipating that total 2010 sales will fall short of 2009. Meanwhile, the median price of homes continues to edge up in the New England states, with the exception of New Hampshire, which observed another month of year-over-year price declines. Contacts attribute increasing median home prices to relatively higher sales of more expensive properties rather than a general upward movement in home prices. Second-home purchases continue to fare well relative to other segments of the market, as higher income buyers take advantage of low mortgage rates and a large inventory of discounted homes. Most contacts report that inventory levels are rising; they do not see this as a source of concern except for a contact in New Hampshire, where the November months of supply exceeded other states in the region.
minneapolis|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|1|Consumer spending during the holiday season increased from a year ago. Sales activity was favorable during December compared with the prior year at a Minneapolis area mall. A North Dakota mall manager reported that traffic was up about 3 percent to 5 percent in December from the previous year. In South Dakota, a mall manager noted strong retail activity during the last week before Christmas; some stores reported lean inventory levels following unanticipated strong holiday sales volumes. Also in South Dakota, a toy retailer reported strong holiday sales compared with a year ago. A chamber of commerce representative in northern Wisconsin reported that area retailers were pleased with the holiday shopping season. A Minnesota bank director noted that holiday shopping began earlier this season.
minneapolis|Construction and Real Estate|2011|1|On balance, commercial construction was flat at low levels. Commercial construction activity has trended downward in Fargo, N.D., and Great Falls, Mont., according to sources there. Commercial builders in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area described activity as mostly stable, though some noted signs of slight increases. November commercial and office permits increased in Sioux Falls, S.D., from a year earlier. Overall residential construction decreased. The value of November residential permits fell 7 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul from a year earlier, though the number of permitted units increased. Home building permits in November fell in value in Sioux Falls, but increased slightly in Fargo from the previous year.
minneapolis|Services|2011|1|Professional business services firms reported increased activity. A contact that supports business travel services noted an unexpected increase in activity since the last report. A large technology company is increasing the number of its contract programmers to support software upgrades. An architectural firm noted an increase in projects up for bid as well as a greater number of bidders. Firms that support the mortgage refinance market noted a sharp decline in activity due to higher long-term interest rates.
minneapolis|Manufacturing|2011|1|output was up since the last report. A December survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. A South Dakota maker of video display systems noted increased new orders since the last report. A Minnesota equipment component producer noted strong sales and was increasing production capacity. A bank director reported that regional manufacturers were busier than a year ago.
minneapolis|Energy and Mining|2011|1|Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the last report. Late-December oil exploration activity increased since mid-November. New wind-energy investments were announced since the last report. Continued strong prices were noted for District mining commodities, and District mines were operating at near capacity. A Montana mine recently signed an agreement that will again supply palladium to a large domestic automaker. In Minnesota, November iron ore production increased from October and a mine plans to upgrade its facility to supply Mexican steel plants.
minneapolis|Agriculture|2011|1|Since the last report, agricultural output prices strengthened, but large snowfalls hampered some ranchers. Prices for most District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including corn, soybeans, wheat, steers and hogs. Snow cover was relatively modest in Montana and South Dakota, but deep snow impeded ranchers in North Dakota and Minnesota.
minneapolis|Employment, Wages, and Prices|2011|1|Labor markets continued to strengthen modestly. According to an ad hoc poll of 104 contacts conducted in early January, 39 percent expect to increase hiring and 11 percent expect to decrease hiring over the next six to 12 months. A representative of a Minnesota-based health care system noted that the pace of hiring health care workers was picking up. A Montana job service office reported a relatively sizable number of job openings posted, but demand for nonskilled workers declined somewhat. A Minnesota iron ore pellet producer recently hired 50 workers and plans to hire 24 more to increase production levels. However, a recreational vehicle manufacturer will lay off 500 workers this spring at a plant in northwestern Wisconsin. In Minnesota, a trucking company recently closed, laying off 210 drivers.
cleveland|Manufacturing|2011|1|Reports from District factories indicate that demand was stable or rising during the past six weeks. Compared to year-ago levels, production was higher, with many contacts experiencing low double-digit increases. Several manufacturers noted that while their production levels declined recently--following seasonal trends--orders were above expectations. In general, manufacturers are fairly optimistic and expect at least modest growth during 2011. A few noted that lead times for the delivery of raw materials were getting longer, which they attributed to rising demand across industry sectors. Steel producers and service centers all reported that shipping volume had increased since our last survey, with shipments being driven by energy-related, transportation, and heavy equipment industries. Steel executives we spoke with have heightened expectations for business growth during 2011. District auto production showed a slight decline during November on a month-over-month basis. Compared to a year ago, domestic auto makers showed a substantial rise in production, while foreign nameplates posted a modest decline.
cleveland|Real Estate|2011|1|New home construction was generally flat at a low level during the past six weeks and on a year-over-year basis, with most sales occurring in the move-up buyer categories. Contractors expect construction to remain sluggish through the winter months. List prices of new homes and discounting have shown little change, while some upward pressure on the cost of building materials was reported. Land purchases and construction of spec homes are constrained by the availability of credit. Subcontractor pricing remains very competitive. General contractors continue to work with lean crews, and no hiring is expected in the near term.
cleveland|Consumer Spending|2011|1|Reports from retailers on the holiday shopping season were generally positive. General merchandise stores had the strongest results, while activity at small specialty outlets was mixed. Almost all of our contacts said that sales increased in the low to mid-single digits when compared to year-ago levels. Some retailers noted that consumers are becoming more confident, and it is beginning to show in their buying patterns. Nonetheless, we still heard mixed reports on purchases of discretionary items. Looking forward to the first quarter of 2011, retailers generally expect transactions to rise in the low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis, and they believe that rising sales will include more discretionary items. Vendor pricing was generally stable. Most retailers plan a modest increase in capital spending during 2011 for remodeling, expansion, and e-business. Hiring was limited to temporary holiday workers and no pickup is expected in the new year.
cleveland|Banking|2011|1|In general, bankers reported that commercial loan demand was stable or showed modest growth since our last survey. A few bankers commented that although loan originations are up, outstanding balances have declined. We also heard reports from some large banks that lending to small businesses is increasing. On the consumer side, conventional loan demand remains soft, although several of our contacts told us that they are beginning to see early signs of growth. Direct and indirect auto lending continues to show strength, while some weakening was observed in the use of home equity lines of credit. Interest rates for business and consumer credit were stable. Many of our contacts said that demand for residential mortgage refinancing has slowed due to the rise in interest rates. New-purchase mortgage originations remain weak. Core deposits continue to grow, with most of the growth occurring in nonmaturing products. Credit quality was characterized as either stable or showing a slight improvement, especially for business applicants. Delinquency rates are stable or trending down. Staffing levels have shown little change during the past few weeks; however, several bankers reported that they are considering hiring during 2011.
cleveland|Energy|2011|1|Reports indicate that oil and gas output from conventional wells was fairly steady during the past six weeks. A small increase in gas production is expected if very cold weather persists. Production from Marcellus shale was somewhat higher and is expected to continue to increase. Spot prices for natural gas have increased slightly with the onset of winter, while wellhead prices paid to independent oil producers were fairly stable. Coal production has been steady since our last report, with little change anticipated in the near term. Spot and contract prices for coal were generally stable; however, the price of metallurgical coal increased slightly. Other than a rise in diesel fuel prices, equipment and material costs have been flat. Staffing has not changed, and it is expected to remain at current levels for the near term.
cleveland|Transportation|2011|1|Freight transport executives reported that shipping volume was stable during the past six weeks. Looking ahead to 2011, most carriers expect growth to be somewhat stronger than they experienced in 2010. They also expect that activity will be more in line with normal seasonal patterns. Almost all of our contacts reported rising prices for diesel fuel, some of which are being passed through to customers via a surcharge. Capital outlays remain at relatively low levels. Spending in 2011 is expected to rise modestly as freight carriers are forced to replace aging equipment. However, some carriers are considering leasing new equipment versus buying, as rising prices for new tractors constrain purchases. Hiring is for replacement only. Two of our contacts noted that they would like to begin hiring additional drivers, but it is difficult to find qualified applicants. Wage pressures are beginning to emerge due to a growing problem with driver turnover and a tightening of the driver pool.
atlanta|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|1|Many District retail stores noted that holiday sales were above their expectations. Most indicated that traffic and sales increased compared with a year ago; however, smaller retailers reported less of an increase in business than larger stores. The majority of businesses contacted noted that sales were driven by a mixture of discounting and stronger demand. The outlook among merchants remained optimistic. District automobile dealers indicated that vehicle sales improved recently and were ahead of year-ago levels. Sales of commercial trucks were also up modestly.
atlanta|Real Estate and Construction|2011|1|Reports from most District homebuilders indicated that the pace of new home sales growth through December remained weak compared with a year ago. Many contacts continued to report that buyers were having a difficult time securing loans. Builders also noted construction activity held steady at very low levels. The outlook was mixed with Florida and Georgia builders expecting weaker activity over the next several months, while elsewhere in the District modest improvements were expected.
atlanta|Manufacturing and Transportation|2011|1|Sixth District manufacturers reported a modest increase in new orders and production levels, while finished inventories contracted only slightly. Several respondents expressed plans to increase production in the short-term. Goods producers tied to the construction sector continued to report very low levels of activity. Manufacturing-related transportation companies reported moderating freight volumes after significant increases earlier this year. Regional rail shipments of farm products increased since the last report, nearly reaching double their year-ago level, while shipments of motor vehicles and equipment declined. The outlook among transportation firms remains optimistic for 2011 as moderate growth in shipments is expected for the first half of the year.
atlanta|Banking and Finance|2011|1|Some surveys indicated that credit standards have eased somewhat in recent months, but remained tight compared with pre-recession levels. Business contacts continued to report that obtaining loans on acceptable terms has remained difficult, especially for new and small businesses. Small businesses whose balance sheets were damaged by the recession reported difficulty qualifying for loans even though their financial situation had improved. Meanwhile, bankers continued to report a lack of loan demand from qualified borrowers.
atlanta|Employment and Prices|2011|1|District labor markets continued to recover, albeit slowly. Business contacts reported that their hiring plans for 2011 have not changed with most remaining hesitant to add to their permanent labor force until they experienced a sustained increase in sales. District firms continued to note a preference for increasing existing staff hours and using part-time or temporary staff. Nevertheless, some contacts noted that they plan to expand their workforce in 2011 at a conservative pace in response to increased output, store openings, or replacing employees lost to attrition or retirement.
atlanta|Natural Resources and Agriculture|2011|1|Regional oil production reached its highest level in over six years in the fourth quarter of 2010 as increased output from offshore platforms boosted production. Although drilling activity remained well below pre-oil spill levels, the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico has crept up since hurricane season ended. Contacts continued to note that the lower pace of drilling permit issuance and additional rig inspections could weigh on future energy output in the Gulf.
new_york|Consumer Spending|2011|1|Virtually all non-auto retail contacts report that holiday season sales were strong and on or ahead of plan, while prices were generally stable. Two major retail chains note that sales in the region were substantially ahead of plan in the weeks leading up to Christmas. A New York State retail association notes that holiday-season sales were stronger than a year ago and stronger than most retailers had expected. While stores in the New York City area generally report brisk sales, a late-December blizzard reportedly curtailed business substantially in the days after Christmas. Two large malls in upstate New York report broad-based strength in sales, despite snowstorms on Black Friday and again in early December; traffic was brisk for most of the holiday season, helped by a steady flow of Canadian shoppers. Most retail contacts report that they hired somewhat more holiday season workers in 2010 than in 2009.
new_york|Construction and Real Estate|2011|1|Housing markets across the District have been sluggish but generally stable since the last report, while new construction activity has remained exceptionally weak. The housing market in western New York State was described as "dead" in November and December. A contact in New Jersey's housing industry reports that market conditions have stabilized but have yet to improve, weighed down by a large inventory of unsold existing homes. Single-family home construction has picked up slightly but remains at a very low level, while multi-family construction has fallen. Transaction prices in northern New Jersey are reported to be flat to declining modestly, though the underlying market is hard to gauge because a disproportionate number of recent transactions are distress sales. New York City's co-op and condo market was relatively stable in the fourth quarter, while the rental market has shown signs of picking up.
new_york|Other Business Activity|2011|1|A major New York City employment agency that specializes in office jobs, reports that business was relatively good in December--typically a slow time of year. Legal sector hiring has rebounded a bit from exceptionally weak levels, while financial sector hiring has continued to improve gradually. Fewer job seekers are coming in than a few months ago. More generally, non-manufacturing firms report that they are adding jobs, on balance, and many plan to increase staffing levels in the first half of 2011. Manufacturing contacts, however, indicate some recent tapering off in employment levels, based on our December survey. Nevertheless, contacts in both manufacturing and other sectors generally indicate that business picked up in December and express widespread optimism about the outlook for the first half of 2011. Contacts also report widening cost pressures but only a modest pickup in their selling prices.
new_york|Financial Developments|2011|1|Small- to medium-sized banks in the District report mixed results for loan demand: they note increased demand for commercial mortgages, on balance, and steady demand for commercial and industrial loans; however, weakening demand is reported for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Bankers indicate steady demand for refinancing, though two large lenders in western New York note a drop in home mortgage refinancing. Respondents report some tightening of credit standards for commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans but little or no change in credit standards for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Bankers note continued narrowing in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly in the commercial and industrial loan category, where slightly over half of bankers indicate a decrease in spreads and only one in ten reports an increase. Respondents also indicate an ongoing decline in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers report that delinquency rates increased for commercial mortgages, decreased for consumer loans, and were little changed for residential mortgages and commercial and industrial loans.
chicago|Consumer Spending|2011|1|Consumer spending increased in December, as holiday retail sales exceeded those of a year ago. Retailers pointed to sales and promotions, rising consumer confidence, and some pent-up demand as potential reasons for better than expected holiday retail sales. Discretionary spending was up this holiday season--apparel, jewelry, and electronics accessories were particularly strong, while big-ticket electronics and furniture performed slightly better than a year ago. In contrast, auto dealers reported that sales held steady in December despite an increase in showroom traffic. Retailers, in general, expressed a positive outlook for 2011, expecting stable, moderate growth in sales in the first half of the year with the potential for spending to accelerate later in the year.
chicago|Business Spending|2011|1|Business spending continued to increase at a steady pace in December. Farmers bought equipment before the end of the year to minimize their 2010 taxes. Several retail and manufacturing contacts reported plans to increase outlays for equipment and structures in 2011. Inventory rebuilding leveled off with both manufacturers and retailers indicating that inventory levels were in a comfortable range given the current pace of sales. Hiring of permanent employees remained limited, although a number of manufacturing contacts reported plans to increase their workforces in the coming year. Several continued to note, however, that finding workers with the right skills remained a problem. Temporary hiring continued at a steady pace, with a large staffing firm reporting stable growth in billable hours. In addition, temporary-to-permanent job transitions were noted to be inching up for professional workers.
chicago|Construction and Real Estate|2011|1|Construction activity was weak in December. Although it edged somewhat lower, the elevated inventory of unsold homes continued to constrain new residential construction. Builders reported a decline in signed contracts and a slight increase in contract cancellations. Contacts also noted that credit was difficult to obtain for refinancing or new construction in neighborhoods where foreclosures and short sales are putting downward pressure on transaction prices and appraisal values. Private nonresidential construction was little changed in December. However, several construction contacts reported negotiations with automakers that are planning to renovate or expand a number of assembly plants in 2011. Although vacancy rates remained elevated, there were some reports of improvement in commercial real estate conditions. In particular, commercial subleasing activity was noted to have increased as pricing continued to be attractive. Public construction, driven by highway and bridge work, was again strong.
chicago|Manufacturing|2011|1|production improved again in December. New orders were solid and order backlogs increased substantially. In general, contacts expressed a positive outlook for growth in manufacturing next year. Several manufacturers of tubes, hydraulics, and other fluid power products noted that activity had returned to its previous peak levels of 2008, and was expected to increase further in the coming year. The fabricated metals, automotive, and heavy equipment sectors were also expected to remain strong sources of growth. A contact reported that global steel consumption was likely to reach an all-time high in 2011. In addition, contacts noted that pent-up demand remains in the motor vehicles sector, with the average age of both light and heavy vehicles still rising. Demand for heavy trucks, in particular, was expected to be even stronger than previously anticipated. In contrast, a contact in the appliance industry noted that shipments were weaker than expected in the fourth quarter, but were still higher than the prior year.
chicago|Banking and Finance|2011|1|Credit conditions continued to improve in December. Corporate credit spreads for a number of large firms in the District were slightly improved even as market interest rates were increasing. Although demand for liquid assets remained elevated, several contacts noted a substantial increase in risk appetite, which, in particular, benefitted equity markets. The profitability of financial firms increased despite tighter interest rate margins, as loan quality continued to improve. Core loan demand from middle market firms remained limited, as these businesses continue to hold large amounts of cash on their balance sheets. However, contacts noted more inquiries for loans to finance merger and acquisitions as well as an end-of-year increase in demand for small business loans. Consumer credit demand was stronger than expected. Financial market participants were cautiously optimistic in their outlook for financial and economic conditions in 2011, although a few questioned the sustainability of recent improvements, as they expected business and household deleveraging to continue for some time.
chicago|Prices and Costs|2011|1|Cost pressures increased in December, but limited pricing power again constrained pass-through to downstream prices. Retailers reported that, on balance, wholesale prices edged up further, although there were some large increases in wholesale apparel prices. Most retailers were accepting lower profit margins with pass-through limited to increases in delivery and other small surcharges. Commodity prices, notably for oil, steel, rubber, and lead, increased. However, contacts thought that only a limited and gradual pass-through of higher materials prices would take place. Wage pressures remained moderate.
chicago|Agriculture|2011|1|Net farm income was higher than a year earlier. Crop insurance helped stabilize revenues in areas where there had been disappointing yields. There were, however, reports that some farmers were taking losses because they earlier had oversold their crop production on futures markets at lower prices. Agricultural land values and farmland cash rental rates for the next growing season increased sharply. Demand for crops remained strong in December, with a notable boost from increased exports to Asia. Crop inventories remained low compared with the high level of demand. Prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat rose during the reporting period. Input costs for crop farms were steady so that margins continued to improve. Hog and cattle prices also increased; while milk prices were generally lower, pressuring the margins of dairy producers.
dallas|Prices|2011|1|Price pressures increased slightly since the last report. Many responding firms noted higher input prices, and a few had increased selling prices including firms in the food, paper, staffing, airline, shipping, and primary and fabricated metals industries. Retailers said prices held steady, but were expected to increase in the second half of 2011.
dallas|Labor|2011|1|Employment levels held steady at most responding firms, although there were some reports of hiring. Staffing firms were hiring for their own needs and in anticipation of continued strong demand going forward. Primary metals and high-tech manufacturing firms reported increasing payrolls, and airlines were hiring in call centers and at airports. A few contacts in the energy industry said they were looking for workers to fill very skilled positions. Wage pressures were minimal.
dallas|Manufacturing|2011|1|Most construction-related manufacturers reported steady demand at low levels, although there were reports of stronger demand related to apartment construction and business remodeling. Outlooks were generally more optimistic than in the last report, with contacts expecting some improvement this year.
dallas|Retail|2011|1|Contacts expect to finish 2010 on a positive note with holiday sales exceeding year-ago levels and outlooks improving modestly. Inventories are at desired levels and in-line with seasonal norms. Two large retailers noted that their sales in the District outperformed those nationwide during the reporting period, but the gap is expected to narrow. The outlook for 2011 remains muted and contacts expect demand to remain flat or grow modestly at best.
dallas|Services|2011|1|Staffing firms reported demand held steady at high levels. Strength remains broad-based, with particularly strong demand for workers with expertise in the professional, technical, healthcare and finance fields. Contacts noted that call centers were becoming a new source of strength. As in the last report, contacts said direct-hire activity was picking up. All contacts had positive outlooks and expect continued strength in 2011.
dallas|Real Estate and Construction|2011|1|The housing market remained weak since the last report. Sales were sluggish at low levels, according to contacts. Homebuilding activity continues to bounce along the bottom. Contacts are cautious in their outlooks but are hopeful that job growth will translate into increased sales this year.
dallas|Financial Services|2011|1|Financial firms reported soft loan demand overall. National institutions noted some pickup in consumer and industrial loan demand, but regional banks reported no change. Commercial real estate lending was weak, with the exception of multifamily. The residential mortgage market was reported as "spotty" across the state, but unchanged overall. Contacts said loan pricing is increasingly competitive. Outlooks remain cautious though more optimistic, and contacts expect to see an uptick in mergers and acquisitions of small banks this year due to the increased cost of regulatory compliance.
dallas|Energy|2011|1|Drilling activity remains high. Crude pricing is strong, and margins are good. Growth in the rig count has slowed due to the continued shift away from dry gas toward more oil-directed drilling, natural gas formations rich in associated oil or natural-gas liquids. The liquid-rich Permian basin and Eagle Ford shale areas in South Texas are booming.
dallas|Agriculture|2011|1|Drought conditions became prevalent in the District in December, with more than 85 percent of Texas classified as abnormally dry or worse. Ranchers felt the immediate impact of the drought, as poor pasture and range conditions necessitated costly supplemental feeding for livestock. Dry land winter wheat was in need of rainfall, and 2011 crops could be adversely affected if soil moisture levels remain low going into spring planting. Demand for agricultural commodities remained above average, and export activity continued to rise for cotton, beef and grains. Prices were strong for most crops, with cotton, wheat and corn prices increasing further. The overall outlook for demand and prices for agricultural commodities is very optimistic.
st_louis|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|1|Manufacturing activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or reduce operations. Firms in the automobile and automobile parts, plastics product, glass, furniture, sanitary paper products, and food manufacturing industries reported plans to expand existing operations and hire new employees. Contacts in the household appliance and paper manufacturing industries reported plans to open new facilities in the District and hire new employees. In contrast, firms in container manufacturing and wood products manufacturing announced plans to close plants and lay off workers.
st_louis|Real Estate and Construction|2011|1|Home sales continued to decline throughout the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2009, November 2010 year-to-date home sales were down 14 percent in St. Louis, 8 percent in Little Rock, 17 percent in Memphis, and 1 percent in Louisville. Residential construction, however, continued to increase throughout most of the District. November 2010 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2009. Permits increased 4 percent in Little Rock and 6 percent in St. Louis and Memphis but decreased 5 percent in Louisville.
st_louis|Banking and Finance|2011|1|Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 2.5 percent in the three-month period from mid-September to mid-December. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.3 percent of total loans, decreased 2.4 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 16.3 percent of total loans, decreased 0.9 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.9 percent of loans, decreased 6.1 percent. All other loans, accounting for 5.5 percent of total loans, decreased 5.3 percent. Over this period, total deposits increased 0.7 percent.
st_louis|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|1|Cotton production was strong in the District. The number of bales of cotton ginned (separated from the seed) increased by 75 percent from 2009 by early December and by 6 percent from the average 2007-2009 levels. The District's mid-December year-to-date coal production increased by 2 percent from 2009, while total coal production from mid-November to mid-December was 5 percent higher compared with the same period in 2009.
philadelphia|Manufacturing|2011|1|Third District manufacturers reported increases in shipments and new orders from November to December, on balance. However, gains were not spread among all of the region's major manufacturing industries. Increases in demand for their products were common among producers of furniture, chemicals, testing and measuring instruments, and food products. In contrast, producers of metals, other industrial materials, lumber products, electrical equipment, and machinery generally had month-to-month declines in orders, and other manufacturing sectors reported no change. Overall, the region's manufacturers continued to report that the flow of new orders has been erratic. Several used the words "hand to mouth" and "choppy" to describe the recent trend in orders.
philadelphia|Retail|2011|1|Third District retailers generally reported year-over-year increases in line with plans for the year-end holiday shopping period. On balance, stores posted moderate increases in sales without significant unscheduled price reductions. Sales of winter outerwear and jewelry rose fairly well from year-ago levels, but sales of big-ticket electronic items were not strong. A snowstorm on the day after Christmas deterred some shoppers and forced some store closings, but merchants said sales picked up in subsequent days. "The shoppers came. We still did well," one merchant said. Looking ahead, most of the retailers surveyed for this report said they expect continued year-over-year increases in sales, although they also noted that consumer confidence remains fragile.
philadelphia|Finance|2011|1|At most of the Third District banks contacted for this report, total outstanding loan volume has increased slightly since the last Beige Book. In general, banks reported increases in lending on home equity lines and credit cards but indicated that other types of lending were practically flat. Some bank lending officers noted that usage of credit lines by business firms continued to be low. Commercial bank officers generally indicated that credit quality measures have been slowly improving. The outlook among Third District bankers surveyed for this report is that lending to both consumers and businesses will move up slowly in 2011. Bankers foresee gradual increases in consumer lending if employment moves up, little or no gain in real estate lending, and a slight increase in commercial and industrial lending.
philadelphia|Real Estate and Construction|2011|1|Third District residential real estate activity has slowed seasonally since the last Beige Book. Both homebuilders and residential real estate agents generally indicated that the usual winter lull in construction and sales had taken hold. In contrast, some real estate agents reported an increase in rental activity of single-family homes. Real estate agents attribute the rise in home rentals to several factors: relocated owners unable to sell their houses at their asking prices, buyers unable to obtain mortgages, and tightening of credit qualifications for renters of apartments. Sales of higher-priced homes have continued to be slower than sales of lower-priced homes in most parts of the region. Home prices have been flat to down in most markets. Residential real estate contacts expect sales to remain sluggish until economic conditions, especially employment, improve. However, several contacts noted that sellers have recently become more willing to reduce asking prices, and this appears to be giving some lift to the sales trend. As one agent remarked, "When sellers get realistic, buyers respond."
philadelphia|Services|2011|1|Service-sector firms generally reported slightly rising activity since the previous Beige Book. Contacts said that the health care sector continued to have relatively better gains than other sectors and that service-sector activity related to construction continued to be weak. The outlook for the services sector as a whole is modestly positive. One contact said, "We see some slight improvement in the near term, but it will be well into 2011 before there is stronger growth."
philadelphia|Prices and Wages|2011|1|Reports from manufacturers since the last Beige Book indicated spreading increases in input costs, but mostly steady output prices. Goods mentioned as rising in price were food products, chemicals, petroleum products, metals, and electrical equipment. Several manufacturers noted evidence of upward price pressure developing in their industries and said they expect more widespread price increases for finished products during 2011. Retailers generally noted more signs of rising costs since the last Beige Book. They cited increases for food products, textile products, shipping charges, and energy. However, many said that competition among stores was limiting increases in retail prices.
summary|Manufacturing|2011|1|The manufacturing sector continued to recover across all Districts. Contacts in the Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts identified a strong flow of new orders. Respondents in the Chicago District pointed to pent-up demand for both light and heavy motor vehicles, attributed to an aging fleet, as a key driver of activity in the manufacturing sector. The Cleveland District described orders as above expectations and respondents in the New York District noted that orders had picked up since the prior report. Overall, demand was generally characterized as stable and steady, and no District made mention of lingering fears of a double-dip recession, in contrast to the summer reporting periods. Capacity utilization continued to trend higher and is approaching normal rates for some contacts in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts, while production in high-tech manufacturing was reportedly at high capacity in Dallas; some manufacturers in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts said they have or will soon expand capacity. Production levels increased in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. On the negative side, the Philadelphia District characterized the flow of new orders as "erratic," while the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts identified construction-related manufacturers as continuing to show considerable weakness, and makers of wood products in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts reported very soft demand.
summary|Consumer Spending and Tourism|2011|1|Retail spending showed improvement across all Districts, with most retailers reporting sales growth consistent with or ahead of plan for the recent 2010 holiday season. Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City observed consumers positively reacting to promotions and discounting, although Philadelphia and San Francisco reported that retailers relied less heavily on discounting. Inclement weather, including the late December blizzard, had some impact on sales in the New York and Philadelphia Districts. New York , Cleveland, and Chicago cited increased consumer confidence.
summary|Nonfinancial Services|2011|1|Activity was said to be steady to increasing among Districts reporting on nonfinancial services. Providers of information technology services saw increases in sales in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Advertising and consulting contacts in the Boston District reported significant growth in demand. In the Dallas District, legal firms noted an uptick in demand for services, while accounting firms reported seasonal slowness. Reports from the healthcare sector were mixed; St. Louis and Minneapolis reported ongoing increases in demand for healthcare workers, while San Francisco indicated a slight weakening in demand for healthcare services and Richmond reported little change. Demand for staffing services remained on an upward trend, with increases reported by New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago. In addition, an employment-agency contact in the New York District observed increased demand for employees in the legal and financial services sectors, while the Dallas District noted strong, steady demand for workers in the professional, technical, healthcare, and finance fields. Reports from the transportation services sector were mixed, with increased demand reported by trucking firms and airports in the Richmond District, and slower overall activity in the Kansas City District. Freight companies in the Cleveland District noted stable volumes over the past six weeks, and contacts in the Atlanta District reported moderating freight volumes after significant increases in earlier 2010 reporting periods.
summary|Real Estate and Construction|2011|1|Activity in residential real estate and new home construction remained slow across all Districts. A majority of the Districts, including Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized local housing markets as weak and sluggish with little change from the previous reporting period. Kansas City noted further weakening, while Richmond received reports of both flat activity and further declines. The St. Louis District saw additional declines in existing home sales, but also cited increased new home construction permits. All Districts attributed slumping activity to concerns about the pace of economic recovery, especially in employment, while the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts mentioned difficulty obtaining credit as another constraint on demand. High levels of existing home inventories continued to damp the pace of new home construction in most Districts reporting on construction, although Boston, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco mentioned pick-ups in multifamily construction within their Districts. Home prices generally declined or held steady in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts; the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts mentioned distressed properties placing downward pressure on prices. Boston reported rising median home prices across most states in the District, but contacts attributed those increases to relatively higher sales of more expensive properties rather than a general upward movement in home prices. Outlooks for residential real estate in the coming year were mixed, with contacts in most Districts described as expecting continued weak conditions.
summary|Banking and Financial Services|2011|1|Reports on credit activity were mixed across Federal Reserve Districts. Overall, loan demand was reported as stable in San Francisco, mixed in New York, steady to slightly softer in Kansas City, weaker in St. Louis and Dallas, and slowly improving in Philadelphia and Richmond. Demand for consumer loans declined in the New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. By contrast, consumer lending increased in the Dallas District, and exceeded expectations in the Chicago District. Bankers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond anticipate consumer lending to expand in 2011. Demand for commercial and industrial loans was flat in New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Lenders in the New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted a drop in residential mortgage refinancing owing to the recent rise in interest rates, whereas Richmond reported strong demand for home refinancing. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts observed a pick-up in auto lending. Demand for residential real estate loans eased in New York and Kansas City, remained weak in Cleveland and Dallas, but increased in the Richmond District. Real estate lending declined in the St. Louis District. Lending in the commercial mortgage category increased in New York, was unchanged in Kansas City, and was weak in Dallas, with the exception of multifamily. Most Districts reporting on credit quality described it as improving, while bankers in the Cleveland District said that quality remained stable or edged up slightly. Reports on credit standards were mixed in New York, while standards were said to have eased somewhat in Atlanta, remained restrictive in San Francisco, and held steady in Kansas City. Delinquency rates were flat or trending down in Cleveland, while delinquency rates in the New York District rose for commercial mortgages, decreased in the consumer lending category, and remained unchanged for all other loans. Total deposits rose in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts and were stable in the Kansas City District.
summary|Agriculture and Natural Resources|2011|1|Unfavorable weather conditions damped agricultural production in some areas. The Dallas District reported that drought negatively affected range conditions by adding to costs of feeding livestock, while Atlanta cited the challenges prolonged drought presented to fruit growers. The Kansas City District indicated that dry weather could affect winter wheat development. Large snow falls hampered some ranchers in the Minneapolis District. However, agricultural demand generally improved among reporting Districts, and output prices rose, especially for corn, soybeans, wheat, cattle, and cotton.
summary|Prices and Labor Markets|2011|1|Most District reports mentioned increasing prevalence of cost pressures but only modest pass-through into final prices because of competitive pressures. Philadelphia and San Francisco noted somewhat reduced discounting in the retail sector during the holiday selling season, while New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated retail prices were stable, Richmond said retail price increases had slowed, and Chicago and Kansas City cited discounting or depressed retail margins. For both retailers and manufacturers, increases in selling prices, if occurring, were said to be selective. Specific markets or products identified as experiencing high or rising prices included various food products, steel and other metals, building materials, textiles, chemicals, and petroleum-related products. Many Districts mentioned concerns among business contacts that petroleum-related prices, already above year-earlier levels, will continue rising in 2011. The Philadelphia and Kansas City reports indicated that manufacturing firms planned to attempt more price increases in 2011, while some manufacturers in the Boston District were uncertain their price increases would stick and the Chicago report projected only "limited and gradual" pass-through.
richmond|Manufacturing|2011|1|activity posted solid gains in December, building on a pickup in October and November. A chemical producer indicated that shipments continued to improve and he expected his operating rate to be at 95 percent of capacity over the next year. He also expected exports, a major part of his recent business gains, to improve further in 2011. An auto-parts supplier said that demand from auto manufacturers continued to exceed initial forecasts, resulting in material shortages and higher supplier costs. A machinery manufacturer noted that his automotive business remained very strong and he anticipated additional strengthening in 2011. He pointed out that other industrial businesses were also picking up nicely. A building materials manufacturer reported that orders were surprisingly strong compared to three months ago, which he attributed at least in part to inventory restocking. Survey contacts reported that prices of raw materials grew at a somewhat quicker rate than in our last report, while prices of finished goods were little changed.
richmond|Retail|2011|1|District retailers reported a surge in December sales, particularly for groceries, toys and apparel, according to our recent survey. Several managers at chain discount stores reported solid sales leading up to Christmas. In addition, retailers indicated that Black Friday sales were brisk at big-box stores, as media attention helped pull in customers, but CyberMonday also brought a big jump in online sales. One exception was big-ticket sales, which continued to languish particularly for items driven by home sales, such as furniture, according to our latest survey. A central Virginia retailer told us that Black Friday left the local cluster of small shops "looking like a ghost town." However, a new promotion, "Small Business Saturday," bolstered sales that weekend.  merchants reported that customer buying patterns have changed; a furniture store owner commented that three out of four of her in-store customers had first browsed the store's website or called for product information. Although snow fell in many areas across the District in mid-December, most roads were clear on the Saturday before Christmas and, thus, the weather did not hinder shoppers.  price growth slowed compared to a month ago, according to our latest survey, while average retail wages grew more quickly.
richmond|Services|2011|1|The District's non-retail services firms generally improved in December from a month earlier. Revenues rose at most services firms, according to recently polled contacts. Demand picked up at trucking firms, and Virginia airports reported increased passenger travel. Telecommunications firms also noted stronger revenue growth. However, demand for healthcare services was little changed since our last report. Several contacts cited difficulty getting business loans. According to participants in our latest survey, price growth eased slightly at services firms, and average wages also moderated somewhat.
richmond|Finance|2011|1|Loan demand in the District continued to improve at a slow pace across most market segments over the last six weeks. One banker noted an uptick in demand for industrial equipment loans, particularly from auto suppliers in the District. Loan demand for autos (notably from fleet purchasers) also picked up. However, the banker also added that consumer demand--excluding auto loans--was flat at his bank, with most new applications being primarily for home improvement projects. Another banker, who reported an increase in consumer loan demand over third-quarter levels, did not expect demand to fade after the holidays. In Richmond, a loan officer stated that consumers were more confident about submitting loan applications, particularly for renovation loans. A regional commercial banker reported improvement in small business lending, especially for equipment leases; she also noted that her bank experienced an increase in SBA loans. While most lending officials reported strong demand for home refinancing, a Richmond banker also cited an improvement in home purchase applications. Only in West Virginia, which lagged in entering the recession, did a banker report that loan demand around the state was still "awfully soft" across most market segments over the last six weeks, and added that there was very little in the pipeline.
richmond|Real Estate|2011|1|Residential real estate activity around the District was mixed over the last six weeks. A Maryland contact reported that sales were down compared to a year ago, but also noted an increase in permits (mostly multi-family). However, a contact in the Charlotte, North Carolina area stated that real estate was flat across the board. Several contacts said that problems getting appraisals approved on a timely basis had reduced sales by discouraging potential buyers and had also increased transaction costs. Several real estate agents in other areas reported that housing had started to move, although at deeply reduced prices. Sales activity varied by price range around the District, with most contacts indicating that sales were concentrated at the low end of the price range. Contacts generally reported that prices were either stable or still declining, although one contact stated that prices in his area were rising moderately.
richmond|Labor Markets|2011|1|Employment activity in the District was generally stable to somewhat stronger in recent weeks. Several firms reported cautiously hiring back employees as the economy improved. Several small retailers in the Richmond area reported that holiday hiring was limited this year; some hired fewer seasonal employees and extended hours for permanent personnel. However, several contacts noted that fewer staff often meant increased theft. Several employment agencies stated that demand for temporary workers was at least stable or stronger than six weeks ago. A temporary employment agency in the Charlotte area reported an uptick in requests from small- and medium-sized firms, whereas previously only large firms were hiring. In contrast, an executive search firm stated that employment activity had stalled in October and had not yet picked up.
richmond|Tourism|2011|1|Assessments of tourist activity remained mostly positive since our last report. Managers at ski resorts in Virginia and West Virginia characterized demand as somewhat stronger than at this time a year ago, as unusually cold weather got the ski season off to an early start. A market analyst reported that the Baltimore area was experiencing its best tourist activity in at least three years. A contact in Myrtle Beach reported a modest increase in resort bookings and noted that tourists were spending more at local shops than a year ago. A contact from the Outer Banks of North Carolina, however, described tourist demand as somewhat weaker than a year ago and characterized holiday spending by tourists on gifts and food as flat to down from a year ago.
kansas_city|Consumer Spending|2011|1|Consumer spending improved in late November and December, and many retailers expected further gains in the coming months. Brisk holiday shopping boosted retail sales with some reports of price discounting. Store managers reported that major appliances and household items sold well. Retail sales were expected to edge up further in the next three months. After improving slightly in the last survey, auto dealers reported limited sales, which contributed to larger vehicle inventories. Dealers were optimistic, however, that auto sales would pick up with additional financing incentives and discounts. Restaurant operators reported stronger overall sales despite a continued decline in the average check amount. Tourism activity improved, and Colorado resorts reported a strong start to the winter ski season. District hoteliers reported average occupancy and room rates fell since the last survey but were above year-ago levels.
kansas_city|Manufacturing and Other Business Activity|2011|1|District manufacturing activity strengthened further since the last survey, and plant managers were increasingly optimistic about future activity. Plant managers reported that production, shipments, and new orders increased in December, led by durable goods manufacturers. During the first half of 2011, manufacturers expected new orders, shipments and production to rise, and finished goods inventories to remain flat. Some factory managers planned to increase employment levels as well as capital spending in the coming months. Stronger demand for computer software and IT consulting contributed to a rise in sales at high-tech firms. Activity in the transportation sector slowed since the last survey period but remained above year-ago levels.
kansas_city|Real Estate and Construction|2011|1|Residential and commercial construction slowed in late November and December, while commercial real estate sales and vacancy rates improved slightly. There was little new home building activity since the last survey period, and construction supply sales were down. Homebuilders and real estate agents noted reduced buyer traffic and a decline in home sales, especially compared to last year when buyers were motivated by the federal tax credit program. With limited sales activity, home inventory levels were expected to grow over the next three months, accompanied by further reductions in home prices. After rising in the last survey period, mortgage loan activity eased with fewer home purchases and less demand for refinancing. Commercial construction activity slowed and was expected to remain weak over the next three months. District commercial real estate contacts, however, reported an uptick in sales and noted prices generally held steady despite further rent reductions. Vacancy rates dipped and were expected to move lower as absorption rates gradually improved.
kansas_city|Banking|2011|1|In the recent survey period, bankers reported generally stable deposits and loan demand with an improved outlook for loan quality over the next few months. Overall loan demand was stable to slightly weaker. Demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans were little changed while demand for residential real estate loans and consumer installment loans decreased. For the third straight survey, credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories. Compared to a year ago, loan quality edged up slightly, and bankers expected loan quality to improve further over the next six months. After rising in the previous survey, bankers reported that deposits held steady.
kansas_city|Agriculture|2011|1|Agricultural growing conditions deteriorated since the last survey period, but rising crop prices supported farm income gains. Continued dry weather across the Southern Plains intensified drought concerns and could affect winter wheat development, especially in Oklahoma and Kansas. Crop prices rose further at year-end, boosting farm incomes. Strong export demand for beef supported an uptick in cattle prices, but hog prices fell with bigger supplies and softer demand for pork. With rising incomes, farm loan repayment rates improved, farm loan renewals and extensions fell, and farm capital spending remained robust. Even with a modest increase in the number of farms for sale, strong demand pushed farmland values higher.
kansas_city|Energy|2011|1|District energy activity expanded further in early November and December. District contacts reported increased drilling activity, driven by additional oil rigs in Oklahoma. While energy producers expected drilling activity to rise in the coming months, some indicated that a lack of qualified labor and limited availability of equipment and services would constrain future drilling activity. Natural gas prices held steady, with ample supplies offsetting higher demand as the winter heating season began. Crude oil prices rose in late November and December, and contacts expected further price gains with stronger global demand and a weaker value of the dollar. Ethanol prices rose with tighter supplies and a one-year extension of the ethanol blenders' credit and tariff. Higher ethanol prices preserved producer profits despite elevated corn prices.
kansas_city|Wages and Prices|2011|1|Wages generally held steady even as some firms reported an uptick in hiring, and prices paid for raw materials rose further. Several contacts across a variety of sectors expected to increase employment over the next six to twelve months, including manufacturing, transportation, high-tech, energy, and retail. However, few employers planned to offer higher salaries, and wage pressures were expected to remain low. Firms that were maintaining or reducing staff levels often cited low sales growth and uncertainty over regulatory costs as reasons for not hiring. District manufacturers reported another jump in raw materials prices and expected more increases would follow. Transportation companies, builders, and construction supply firms also expected input prices to rise, especially for fuel and petroleum-based products such as roofing shingles. More plant managers planned to pass higher input costs to finished goods prices, and several transportation and high-tech firms anticipated raising prices in the next three months. In contrast, District contacts in the retail sector noted some price discounting during the holiday sales season, in addition to reduced hotel rates and more incentives offered by auto dealers. Most retailers expected selling prices to hold steady in coming months. Menu prices remained flat at restaurants despite a steep rise in food costs.
